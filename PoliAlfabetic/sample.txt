If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is
where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were
occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I
don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff
bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece
if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like
that, especially my father. They're nice and all--I'm not saying that--but they're also
touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or
anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last
Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I
mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That
isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every
week end. He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a
Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It
cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to.
He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of
short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was
"The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his
goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he's out in
Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even
mention them to me.
Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've probably seen
the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some
hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was
play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And
underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been
molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don't
do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know
anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that
many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game 
of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't
win. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on
top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War
and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams
bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you
could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the
whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side,
because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.
 There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were
allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.
I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even
if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or
something. Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the
games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She
was a pretty nice girl, though. I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we
sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all
bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the
place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of
horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony
slob he was.
 The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game,
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam
manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York that morning for
this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the meet. I left all the
foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn't all my fault. I had to keep
getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey
around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole
way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.
 The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say
good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I probably
wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he
wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.
 I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn't supposed to come
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying
myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself--especially
around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer--but I
didn't do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a
very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.
 Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on
top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The week
before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my furlined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came
from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a
school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that
crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching
the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind 
of a good-by. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I
hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like
to know I'm leaving it. If you don't, you feel even worse.
 I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I
was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and
Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the
academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner
and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept
getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want
to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology,
Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to
go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of
stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one--at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I
got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old
Spencer's house. He didn't live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.
 I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I
have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that
is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last
year. That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam
checkups and stuff. I'm pretty healthy, though.
 Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204. It was icy as hell
and I damn near fell down. I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt
like it. After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing. It was that kind of
a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were
disappearing every time you crossed a road.
 Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house. I was really
frozen. My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. "C'mon, c'mon,"
I said right out loud, almost, "somebody open the door." Finally old Mrs. Spencer
opened. it. They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door
themselves. They didn't have too much dough.
 "Holden!" Mrs. Spencer said. "How lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are you
frozen to death?" I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think she did.
 Boy, did I get in that house fast. "How are you, Mrs. Spencer?" I said. "How's Mr.
Spencer?"
 "Let me take your coat, dear," she said. She didn't hear me ask her how Mr.
Spencer was. She was sort of deaf.
 She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with
my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much. "How've
you been, Mrs. Spencer?" I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.
 "I've been just fine, Holden." She closed the closet door. "How have you been?"
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out.
 "Fine," I said. "How's Mr. Spencer? He over his grippe yet?"
 "Over it! Holden, he's behaving like a perfect--I don't know what. . . He's in his
room, dear. Go right in."

 They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old,
or even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of
course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean that I used
to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you
wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he
had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the
blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to
him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too
much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself. For instance, one
Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this
old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in
Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's
what I mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big
bang out of buying a blanket.
 His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I
could see where he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in
that blanket I just told you about. He looked over at me when I knocked. "Who's that?" he
yelled. "Caulfield? Come in, boy." He was always yelling, outside class. It got on your
nerves sometimes.
 The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come. He was reading the Atlantic
Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled
like Vicks Nose Drops. It was pretty depressing. I'm not too crazy about sick people,
anyway. What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old
bathrobe that he was probably born in or something. I don't much like to see old guys in
their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy old chests are always showing. And
their legs. Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy.
"Hello, sir," I said. "I got your note. Thanks a lot." He'd written me this note asking me to
stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back.
"You didn't have to do all that. I'd have come over to say good-by anyway."
 "Have a seat there, boy," old Spencer said. He meant the bed.
 I sat down on it. "How's your grippe, sir?"
 "M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor," old Spencer said. That
knocked him out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened
himself out and said, "Why aren't you down at the game? I thought this was the day of the
big game."
 "It is. I was. Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team," I said.
Boy, his bed was like a rock.
 He started getting serious as hell. I knew he would. "So you're leaving us, eh?" he
said.
 "Yes, sir. I guess I am."
 He started going into this nodding routine. You never saw anybody nod as much
in your life as old Spencer did. You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was
thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his
elbow. 
 "What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy? I understand you had quite a little chat."
 "Yes, we did. We really did. I was in his office for around two hours, I guess."
 "What'd he say to you?"
 "Oh. . . well, about Life being a game and all. And how you should play it
according to the rules. He was pretty nice about it. I mean he didn't hit the ceiling or
anything. He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know."
 "Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules."
 "Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it."
 Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then
it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't
any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game. "Has Dr. Thurmer written
to your parents yet?" old Spencer asked me.
 "He said he was going to write them Monday."
 "Have you yourself communicated with them?"
 "No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them
Wednesday night when I get home."
 "And how do you think they'll take the news?"
 "Well. . . they'll be pretty irritated about it," I said. "They really will. This is about
the fourth school I've gone to." I shook my head. I shake my head quite a lot. "Boy!" I
said. I also say "Boy!" quite a lot. Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly
because I act quite young for my age sometimes. I was sixteen then, and I'm seventeen
now, and sometimes I act like I'm about thirteen. It's really ironical, because I'm six foot
two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of my head--the right side--
is full of millions of gray hairs. I've had them ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act
sometimes like I was only about twelve. Everybody says that, especially my father. It's
partly true, too, but it isn't all true. People always think something's all true. I don't give a
damn, except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I
act a lot older than I am--I really do--but people never notice it. People never notice
anything.
 Old Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made out
like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in there. I guess
he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room. I didn't care,
except that it's pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose.
 Then he said, "I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had
their little chat with Dr. Thurmer some weeks ago. They're grand people."
 "Yes, they are. They're very nice."
 Grand. There's a word I really hate. It's a phony. I could puke every time I hear it.
 Then all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good,
something sharp as a tack, to say to me. He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved
around. It was a false alarm, though. All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off his lap
and try to chuck it on the bed, next to me. He missed. It was only about two inches away,
but he missed anyway. I got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed. All of a
sudden then, I wanted to get the hell out of the room. I could feel a terrific lecture coming
on. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I didn't feel like being lectured to and smell Vicks
Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time. I
really didn't. 
 It started, all right. "What's the matter with you, boy?" old Spencer said. He said it
pretty tough, too, for him. "How many subjects did you carry this term?"
 "Five, sir."
 "Five. And how many are you failing in?"
 "Four." I moved my ass a little bit on the bed. It was the hardest bed I ever sat on.
"I passed English all right," I said, "because I had all that Beowulf and Lord Randal My
Son stuff when I was at the Whooton School. I mean I didn't have to do any work in
English at all hardly, except write compositions once in a while."
 He wasn't even listening. He hardly ever listened to you when you said
something.
 "I flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing."
 "I know that, sir. Boy, I know it. You couldn't help it."
 "Absolutely nothing," he said over again. That's something that drives me crazy.
When people say something twice that way, after you admit it the first time. Then he said
it three times. "But absolutely nothing. I doubt very much if you opened your textbook
even once the whole term. Did you? Tell the truth, boy."
 "Well, I sort of glanced through it a couple of times," I told him. I didn't want to
hurt his feelings. He was mad about history.
 "You glanced through it, eh?" he said--very sarcastic. "Your, ah, exam paper is
over there on top of my chiffonier. On top of the pile. Bring it here, please."
 It was a very dirty trick, but I went over and brought it over to him--I didn't have
any alternative or anything. Then I sat down on his cement bed again. Boy, you can't
imagine how sorry I was getting that I'd stopped by to say good-by to him.
 He started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something. "We studied
the Egyptians from November 4th to December 2nd," he said. "You chose to write about
them for the optional essay question. Would you care to hear what you had to say?"
 "No, sir, not very much," I said.
 He read it anyway, though. You can't stop a teacher when they want to do
something. They just do it.
 The Egyptians were an ancient race of Caucasians residing in
 one of the northern sections of Africa. The latter as we all
 know is the largest continent in the Eastern Hemisphere.
 I had to sit there and listen to that crap. It certainly was a dirty trick.
 The Egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for
 various reasons. Modern science would still like to know what
 the secret ingredients were that the Egyptians used when they
 wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for
 innumerable centuries. This interesting riddle is still quite
 a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century.
 He stopped reading and put my paper down. I was beginning to sort of hate him.
"Your essay, shall we say, ends there," he said in this very sarcastic voice. You wouldn't 
think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all. "However, you dropped me a little
note, at the bottom of the page," he said.
 "I know I did," I said. I said it very fast because I wanted to stop him before he
started reading that out loud. But you couldn't stop him. He was hot as a firecracker.
 DEAR MR. SPENCER [he read out loud]. That is all I know about
 the Egyptians. I can't seem to get very interested in them
 although your lectures are very interesting. It is all right
 with me if you flunk me though as I am flunking everything
 else except English anyway.
 Respectfully yours, HOLDEN CAULFIELD.
 He put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he'd just beaten hell
out of me in ping-pong or something. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for reading me
that crap out loud. I wouldn't've read it out loud to him if he'd written it--I really wouldn't.
In the first place, I'd only written that damn note so that he wouldn't feel too bad about
flunking me.
 "Do you blame me for flunking you, boy?" he said.
 "No, sir! I certainly don't," I said. I wished to hell he'd stop calling me "boy" all
the time.
 He tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it. Only,
he missed again, naturally. I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the
Atlantic Monthly. It's boring to do that every two minutes.
 "What would you have done in my place?" he said. "Tell the truth, boy."
 Well, you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me. So I shot the
bull for a while. I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff. I told him how I
would've done exactly the same thing if I'd been in his place, and how most people didn't
appreciate how tough it is being a teacher. That kind of stuff. The old bull.
 The funny thing is, though, I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot
the bull. I live in New York, and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park, down
near Central Park South. I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I got home,
and if it was, where did the ducks go. I was wondering where the ducks went when the
lagoon got all icy and frozen over. I wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them
away to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away.
 I'm lucky, though. I mean I could shoot the old bull to old Spencer and think
about those ducks at the same time. It's funny. You don't have to think too hard when you
talk to a teacher. All of a sudden, though, he interrupted me while I was shooting the bull.
He was always interrupting you.
 "How do you feel about all this, boy? I'd be very interested to know. Very
interested."
 "You mean about my flunking out of Pencey and all?" I said. I sort of wished he'd
cover up his bumpy chest. It wasn't such a beautiful view.
 "If I'm not mistaken, I believe you also had some difficulty at the Whooton
School and at Elkton Hills." He didn't say it just sarcastic, but sort of nasty, too.
 "I didn't have too much difficulty at Elkton Hills," I told him. "I didn't exactly
flunk out or anything. I just quit, sort of." 
 "Why, may I ask?"
 "Why? Oh, well it's a long story, sir. I mean it's pretty complicated." I didn't feel
like going into the whole thing with him. He wouldn't have understood it anyway. It
wasn't up his alley at all. One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was
surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. For
instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in
my life. Ten times worse than old Thurmer. On Sundays, for instance, old Haas went
around shaking hands with everybody's parents when they drove up to school. He'd be
charming as hell and all. Except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents. You
should've seen the way he did with my roommate's parents. I mean if a boy's mother was
sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody's father was one of those guys
that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old
Hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go
talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else's parents. I can't stand that stuff. It
drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills.
 Old Spencer asked me something then, but I didn't hear him. I was thinking about
old Haas. "What, sir?" I said.
 "Do you have any particular qualms about leaving Pencey?"
 "Oh, I have a few qualms, all right. Sure. . . but not too many. Not yet, anyway. I
guess it hasn't really hit me yet. It takes things a while to hit me. All I'm doing right now
is thinking about going home Wednesday. I'm a moron."
 "Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?"
 "Oh, I feel some concern for my future, all right. Sure. Sure, I do." I thought about
it for a minute. "But not too much, I guess. Not too much, I guess."
 "You will," old Spencer said. "You will, boy. You will when it's too late."
 I didn't like hearing him say that. It made me sound dead or something. It was
very depressing. "I guess I will," I said.
 "I'd like to put some sense in that head of yours, boy. I'm trying to help you. I'm
trying to help you, if I can."
 He really was, too. You could see that. But it was just that we were too much on
opposite sides ot the pole, that's all. "I know you are, sir," I said. "Thanks a lot. No
kidding. I appreciate it. I really do." I got up from the bed then. Boy, I couldn't've sat
there another ten minutes to save my life. "The thing is, though, I have to get going now.
I have quite a bit of equipment at the gym I have to get to take home with me. I really
do." He looked up at me and started nodding again, with this very serious look on his
face. I felt sorry as hell for him, all of a sudden. But I just couldn't hang around there any
longer, the way we were on opposite sides of the pole, and the way he kept missing the
bed whenever he chucked something at it, and his sad old bathrobe with his chest
showing, and that grippy smell of Vicks Nose Drops all over the place. "Look, sir. Don't
worry about me," I said. "I mean it. I'll be all right. I'm just going through a phase right
now. Everybody goes through phases and all, don't they?"
 "I don't know, boy. I don't know."
 I hate it when somebody answers that way. "Sure. Sure, they do," I said. "I mean
it, sir. Please don't worry about me." I sort of put my hand on his shoulder. "Okay?" I
said. 
 "Wouldn't you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go? Mrs. Spencer would be-
-"
 "I would, I really would, but the thing is, I have to get going. I have to go right to
the gym. Thanks, though. Thanks a lot, sir."
 Then we shook hands. And all that crap. It made me feel sad as hell, though.
 "I'll drop you a line, sir. Take care of your grippe, now."
 "Good-by, boy."
 After I shut the door and started back to the living room, he yelled something at
me, but I couldn't exactly hear him. I'm pretty sure he yelled "Good luck!" at me,
 I hope to hell not. I'd never yell "Good luck!" at anybody. It sounds terrible, when
you think about it.
3
 I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to
the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to
say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym
and get my equipment and stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don't even keep my goddam
equipment in the gym.
 Where I lived at Pencey, I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new
dorms. It was only for juniors and seniors. I was a junior. My roommate was a senior. It
was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a pot of dough in
the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey. What he did, he started these
undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family
buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old Ossenburger. He probably just
shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he gave Pencey a pile of
dough, and they named our wing alter him. The first football game of the year, he came
up to school in this big goddam Cadillac, and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and
give him a locomotive--that's a cheer. Then, the next morning, in chapel, be made a
speech that lasted about ten hours. He started off with about fifty corny jokes, just to
show us what a regular guy he was. Very big deal. Then he started telling us how he was
never ashamed, when he was in some kind of trouble or something, to get right down his
knees and pray to God. He told us we should always pray to God--talk to Him and all--
wherever we were. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he
talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see
the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more
stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling us all
about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy
sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart. It was a very crude
thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing. Old Marsalla. He damn near
blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud, and old Ossenburger made out like
he didn't even hear it, but old Thurmer, the headmaster, was sitting right next to him on
the rostrum and all, and you could tell he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn't say
anything then, but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic
building and he came up and made a speech. He said that the boy that had created the 
disturbance in chapel wasn't fit to go to Pencey. We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off
another one, right while old Thurmer was making his speech, but be wasn't in the right
mood. Anyway, that's where I lived at Pencey. Old Ossenburger Memorial Wing, in the
new dorms.
 It was pretty nice to get back to my room, after I left old Spencer, because
everybody was down at the game, and the heat was on in our room, for a change. It felt
sort of cosy. I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar; and then I put
on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting hat, with one
of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out
of the subway, just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck.
The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back--very corny, I'll admit,
but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way. Then I got this book I was reading
and sat down in my chair. There were two chairs in every room. I had one and my
roommate, Ward Stradlater, had one. The arms were in sad shape, because everybody
was always sitting on them, but they were pretty comfortable chairs.
 The book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake. They
gave me the wrong book, and I didn't notice it till I got back to my room. They gave me
Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen. I thought it was going to stink, but it didn't. It was a very
good book. I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot. My favorite author is my brother D.B., and
my next favorite is Ring Lardner. My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my
birthday, just before I went to Pencey. It had these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then
it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that's
always speeding. Only, he's married, the cop, so be can't marry her or anything. Then this
girl gets killed, because she's always speeding. That story just about killed me. What I
like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while. I read a lot of classical books, like
The Return of the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and
mysteries and all, but they don't knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a
book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific
friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That
doesn't happen much, though. I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring
Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead. You take that book Of Human Bondage, by
Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It's a pretty good book and all, but I
wouldn't want to call Somerset Maugham up. I don't know, He just isn't the kind of guy
I'd want to call up, that's all. I'd rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye.
 Anyway, I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of
Africa. I'd read it already, but I wanted to read certain parts over again. I'd only read
about three pages, though, when I heard somebody coming through the shower curtains.
Even without looking up, I knew right away who it was. It was Robert Ackley, this guy
that roomed right next to me. There was a shower right between every two rooms in our
wing, and about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me. He was probably the
only guy in the whole dorm, besides me, that wasn't down at the game. He hardly ever
went anywhere. He was a very peculiar guy. He was a senior, and he'd been at Pencey the
whole four years and all, but nobody ever called him anything except "Ackley." Not even
Herb Gale, his own roommate, ever called him "Bob" or even "Ack." If he ever gets
married, his own wife'll probably call him "Ackley." He was one of these very, very tall,
round-shouldered guys--he was about six four--with lousy teeth. The whole time he 
roomed next to me, I never even once saw him brush his teeth. They always looked
mossy and awful, and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room
with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something. Besides that, he had a lot
of pimples. Not just on his forehead or his chin, like most guys, but all over his whole
face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy. I
wasn't too crazy about him, to tell you the truth.
 I could feel him standing on the shower ledge, right behind my chair, taking a
look to see if Stradlater was around. He hated Stradlater's guts and he never came in the
room if Stradlater was around. He hated everybody's guts, damn near.
 He came down off the shower ledge and came in the room. "Hi," he said. He
always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired. He didn't want you to
think he was visiting you or anything. He wanted you to think he'd come in by mistake,
for God's sake.
 "Hi," I said, but I didn't look up from my book. With a guy like Ackley, if you
looked up from your book you were a goner. You were a goner anyway, but not as quick
if you didn't look up right away.
 He started walking around the room, very slow and all, the way he always did,
picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier. He always picked up your
personal stuff and looked at it. Boy, could he get on your nerves sometimes. "How was
the fencing?" he said. He just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself. He didn't
give a damn about the fencing. "We win, or what?" he said.
 "Nobody won," I said. Without looking up, though.
 "What?" he said. He always made you say everything twice.
 "Nobody won," I said. I sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with
on my chiffonier. He was looking at this picture of this girl I used to go around with in
New York, Sally Hayes. He must've picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at
least five thousand times since I got it. He always put it back in the wrong place, too,
when he was finished. He did it on purpose. You could tell.
 "Nobody won," he said. "How come?"
 "I left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway." I still didn't look up at him.
 "On the subway, for Chrissake! Ya lost them, ya mean?"
 "We got on the wrong subway. I had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map
on the wall."
 He came over and stood right in my light. "Hey," I said. "I've read this same
sentence about twenty times since you came in."
 Anybody else except Ackley would've taken the goddam hint. Not him, though.
"Think they'll make ya pay for em?" he said.
 "I don't know, and I don't give a damn. How 'bout sitting down or something,
Ackley kid? You're right in my goddam light." He didn't like it when you called him
"Ackley kid." He was always telling me I was a goddam kid, because I was sixteen and
he was eighteen. It drove him mad when I called him "Ackley kid."
 He kept standing there. He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn't get out of
your light when you asked him to. He'd do it, finally, but it took him a lot longer if you
asked him to. "What the hellya reading?" he said.
 "Goddam book." 
 He shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it. "Any
good?" he said.
 "This sentence I'm reading is terrific." I can be quite sarcastic when I'm in the
mood. He didn't get It, though. He started walking around the room again, picking up all
my personal stuff, and Stradlater's. Finally, I put my book down on the floor. You
couldn't read anything with a guy like Ackley around. It was impossible.
 I slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at
home. I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all, and I started yawning.
Then I started horsing around a little bit. Sometimes I horse around quite a lot, just to
keep from getting bored. What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around
to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way, I couldn't see a goddam
thing. "I think I'm going blind," I said in this very hoarse voice. "Mother darling,
everything's getting so dark in here."
 "You're nuts. I swear to God," Ackley said.
 "Mother darling, give me your hand, Why won't you give me your hand?"
 "For Chrissake, grow up."
 I started groping around in front of me, like a blind guy, but without getting up or
anything. I kept saying, "Mother darling, why won't you give me your hand?" I was only
horsing around, naturally. That stuff gives me a bang sometimes. Besides, I know it
annoyed hell out of old Ackley. He always brought out the old sadist in me. I was pretty
sadistic with him quite often. Finally, I quit, though. I pulled the peak around to the back
again, and relaxed.
 "Who belongsa this?" Ackley said. He was holding my roommate's knee
supporter up to show me. That guy Ackley'd pick up anything. He'd even pick up your
jock strap or something. I told him it was Stradlater's. So he chucked it on Stradlater's
bed. He got it off Stradlater's chiffonier, so he chucked it on the bed.
 He came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlater's chair. He never sat down in
a chair. Just always on the arm. "Where the hellja get that hat?" he said.
 "New York."
 "How much?"
 "A buck."
 "You got robbed." He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a
match. He was always cleaning his fingernails. It was funny, in a way. His teeth were
always mossy-looking, and his ears were always dirty as hell, but he was always cleaning
his fingernails. I guess he thought that made him a very neat guy. He took another look at
my hat while he was cleaning them. "Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in,
for Chrissake," he said. "That's a deer shooting hat."
 "Like hell it is." I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was
taking aim at it. "This is a people shooting hat," I said. "I shoot people in this hat."
 "Your folks know you got kicked out yet?"
 "Nope."
 "Where the hell's Stradlater at, anyway?"
 "Down at the game. He's got a date." I yawned. I was yawning all over the place.
For one thing, the room was too damn hot. It made you sleepy. At Pencey, you either
froze to death or died of the heat. 
 "The great Stradlater," Ackley said. "--Hey. Lend me your scissors a second,
willya? Ya got 'em handy?"
 "No. I packed them already. They're way in the top of the closet."
 "Get 'em a second, willya?" Ackley said, "I got this hangnail I want to cut off."
 He didn't care if you'd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the
closet. I got them for him though. I nearly got killed doing it, too. The second I opened
the closet door, Stradlater's tennis racket--in its wooden press and all--fell right on my
head. It made a big clunk, and it hurt like hell. It damn near killed old Ackley, though. He
started laughing in this very high falsetto voice. He kept laughing the whole time I was
taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him. Something like that--a guy
getting hit on the head with a rock or something--tickled the pants off Ackley. "You have
a damn good sense of humor, Ackley kid," I told him. "You know that?" I handed him the
scissors. "Lemme be your manager. I'll get you on the goddam radio." I sat down in my
chair again, and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails. "How 'bout using the table
or something?" I said. "Cut 'em over the table, willya? I don't feel like walking on your
crumby nails in my bare feet tonight." He kept right on cutting them over the floor,
though. What lousy manners. I mean it.
 "Who's Stradlater's date?" he said. He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater
was dating, even though he hated Stradlater's guts.
 "I don't know. Why?"
 "No reason. Boy, I can't stand that sonuvabitch. He's one sonuvabitch I really can't
stand."
 "He's crazy about you. He told me he thinks you're a goddam prince," I said. I call
people a "prince" quite often when I'm horsing around. It keeps me from getting bored or
something.
 "He's got this superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I just can't stand the
sonuvabitch. You'd think he--"
 "Do you mind cutting your nails over the table, hey?" I said. "I've asked you about
fifty--"
 "He's got this goddam superior attitude all the time," Ackley said. "I don't even
think the sonuvabitch is intelligent. He thinks he is. He thinks he's about the most--"
 "Ackley! For Chrissake. Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table? I've
asked you fifty times."
 He started cutting his nails over the table, for a change. The only way he ever did
anything was if you yelled at him.
 I watched him for a while. Then I said, "The reason you're sore at Stradlater is
because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while. He didn't mean to
insult you, for cryin' out loud. He didn't say it right or anything, but he didn't mean
anything insulting. All he meant was you'd look better and feel better if you sort of
brushed your teeth once in a while."
 "I brush my teeth. Don't gimme that."
 "No, you don't. I've seen you, and you don't," I said. I didn't say it nasty, though. I
felt sort of sorry for him, in a way. I mean it isn't too nice, naturally, if somebody tells
you you don't brush your teeth. "Stradlater's all right He's not too bad," I said. "You don't
know him, thats the trouble."
 "I still say he's a sonuvabitch. He's a conceited sonuvabitch." 
 "He's conceited, but he's very generous in some things. He really is," I said.
"Look. Suppose, for instance, Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked.
Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot--I'm just giving you an example, now.
You know what he'd do? He'd probably take it off and give it ta you. He really would.
Or--you know what he'd do? He'd leave it on your bed or something. But he'd give you
the goddam tie. Most guys would probably just--"
 "Hell," Ackley said. "If I had his dough, I would, too."
 "No, you wouldn't." I shook my head. "No, you wouldn't, Ackley kid. If you had
his dough, you'd be one of the biggest--"
 "Stop calling me 'Ackley kid,' God damn it. I'm old enough to be your lousy
father."
 "No, you're not." Boy, he could really be aggravating sometimes. He never missed
a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen. "In the first place, I
wouldn't let you in my goddam family," I said.
 "Well, just cut out calling me--"
 All of a sudden the door opened, and old Stradlater barged in, in a big hurry. He
was always in a big hurry. Everything was a very big deal. He came over to me and gave
me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks--which is something that can be very
annoying. 'Listen," he said. "You going out anywheres special tonight?"
 "I don't know. I might. What the hell's it doing out--snowing?" He had snow all
over his coat.
 "Yeah. Listen. If you're not going out anyplace special, how 'bout lending me
your hound's-tooth jacket?"
 "Who won the game?" I said.
 "It's only the half. We're leaving," Stradlater said. "No kidding, you gonna use
your hound's-tooth tonight or not? I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel."
 "No, but I don't want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all," I
said. We were practically the same heighth, but he weighed about twice as much as I did.
He had these very broad shoulders.
 "I won't stretch it." He went over to the closet in a big hurry. "How'sa boy,
Ackley?" he said to Ackley. He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater. It was partly
a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all.
 Ackley just sort of grunted when he said "How'sa boy?" He wouldn't answer him,
but he didn't have guts enough not to at least grunt. Then he said to me, "I think I'll get
going. See ya later."
 "Okay," I said. He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own
room.
 Old Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all. "I think maybe I'll take a
fast shave," he said. He had a pretty heavy beard. He really did.
 "Where's your date?" I asked him.
 "She's waiting in the Annex." He went out of the room with his toilet kit and
towel under his arm. No shirt on or anything. He always walked around in his bare torso
because he thought he had a damn good build. He did, too. I have to admit it.
4 
 I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag
with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody
was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There
were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat
down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off--this
nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling 'Song of India" while he shaved. He had
one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always
picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like "Song of
India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up.
 You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well,
so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always
looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved
himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never
cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up,
but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed
himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he
was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too--I'll
admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his
picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say, "Who's this boy?" I mean he was
mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were
a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn't look handsome if you saw their
pictures in the Year Book. They'd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I've
had that experience frequently.
 Anyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort
of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak around to
the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat.
 "Hey," Stradlater said. "Wanna do me a big favor?"
 "What?" I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big
favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and they're
always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about themseif, they
think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do them a favor. It's sort
of funny, in a way.
 "You goin' out tonight?" he said.
 "I might. I might not. I don't know. Why?"
 "I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday," he said. "How 'bout
writing a composition for me, for English? I'll be up the creek if I don't get the goddam
thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How 'bout it?"
 It was very ironical. It really was.
 "I'm the one that's flunking out of the goddam place, and you're asking me to
write you a goddam composition," I said.
 "Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'll be up the creek if I don't get it in. Be a
buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?"
 I didn't answer him right away. Suspense is good for some bastards like
Stradlater.
 "What on?" I said. 
 "Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once
lived in or something-- you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell." He gave out a
big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass. I
mean if somebody yawns right while they're asking you to do them a goddam favor. "Just
don't do it too good, is all," he said. "That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in
English, and he knows you're my roommate. So I mean don't stick all the commas and
stuff in the right place."
 That's something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you're good at writing
compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always doing
that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions
was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a little bit like Ackley,
that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game. We had a terrific guy on the
team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even
touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that
Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff.
 I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and
started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I can't really
tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was good for tap-dancing.
I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one of those musicals. I hate the
movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them. Old Stradlater watched me in the
mirror while he was shaving. All I need's an audience. I'm an exhibitionist. "I'm the
goddarn Governor's son," I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the
place. "He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in
my goddam blood, tap-dancing." Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense
of humor. "It's the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies." I was getting out of breath. I
have hardly any wind at all. "The leading man can't go on. He's drunk as a bastard. So
who do they get to take his place? Me, that's who. The little ole goddam Governor's son."
 "Where'dja get that hat?" Stradlater said. He meant my hunting hat. He'd never
seen it before.
 I was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked
at it for about the ninetieth time. "I got it in New York this morning. For a buck. Ya like
it?"
 Stradlater nodded. "Sharp," he said. He was only flattering me, though, because
right away he said, "Listen. Are ya gonna write that composition for me? I have to
know."
 "If I get the time, I will. If I don't, I won't," I said. I went over and sat down at the
washbowl next to him again. "Who's your date?" I asked him. "Fitzgerald?"
 "Hell, no! I told ya. I'm through with that pig."
 "Yeah? Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She's my type."
 "Take her . . . She's too old for you."
 All of a sudden--for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of in the mood
for horsing around--I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a
half nelson. That's a wrestling hold, in case you don't know, where you get the other guy
around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I landed on him
like a goddam panther. 
 "Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!" Stradlater said. He didn't feel like horsing
around. He was shaving and all. "Wuddaya wanna make me do--cut my goddam head
off?"
 I didn't let go, though. I had a pretty good half nelson on him. "Liberate yourself
from my viselike grip." I said.
 "Je-sus Christ." He put down his razor, and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and
sort of broke my hold on him. He was a very strong guy. I'm a very weak guy. "Now, cut
out the crap," he said. He started shaving himself all over again. He always shaved
himself twice, to look gorgeous. With his crumby old razor.
 "Who is your date if it isn't Fitzgerald?" I asked him. I sat down on the washbowl
next to him again. "That Phyllis Smith babe?"
 "No. It was supposed to he, but the arrangements got all screwed up. I got Bud
Thaw's girl's roommate now . . . Hey. I almost forgot. She knows you."
 "Who does?" I said.
 "My date."
 "Yeah?" I said. "What's her name?" I was pretty interested.
 "I'm thinking . . . Uh. Jean Gallagher."
 Boy, I nearly dropped dead when he said that.
 "Jane Gallagher," I said. I even got up from the washbowl when he said that. I
damn near dropped dead. "You're damn right I know her. She practically lived right next
door to me, the summer before last. She had this big damn Doberman pinscher. That's
how I met her. Her dog used to keep coming over in our--"
 "You're right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake," Stradlater said. "Ya have to
stand right there?"
 Boy, was I excited, though. I really was.
 "Where is she?" I asked him. "I oughta go down and say hello to her or
something. Where is she? In the Annex?"
 "Yeah."
 "How'd she happen to mention me? Does she go to B.M. now? She said she might
go there. She said she might go to Shipley, too. I thought she went to Shipley. How'd she
happen to mention me?" I was pretty excited. I really was.
 "I don't know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You're on my towel," Stradlater
said. I was sitting on his stupid towel.
 "Jane Gallagher," I said. I couldn't get over it. "Jesus H. Christ."
 Old Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair. My Vitalis.
 "She's a dancer," I said. "Ballet and all. She used to practice about two hours
every day, right in the middle of the hottest weather and all. She was worried that it might
make her legs lousy--all thick and all. I used to play checkers with her all the time."
 "You used to play what with her all the time?"
 "Checkers."
 "Checkers, for Chrissake!"
 "Yeah. She wouldn't move any of her kings. What she'd do, when she'd get a king,
she wouldn't move it. She'd just leave it in the back row. She'd get them all lined up in the
back row. Then she'd never use them. She just liked the way they looked when they were
all in the back row."
 Stradlater didn't say anything. That kind of stuff doesn't interest most people. 
 "Her mother belonged to the same club we did," I said. "I used to caddy once in a
while, just to make some dough. I caddy'd for her mother a couple of times. She went
around in about a hundred and seventy, for nine holes."
 Stradlater wasn't hardly listening. He was combing his gorgeous locks.
 "I oughta go down and at least say hello to her," I said.
 "Why don'tcha?"
 "I will, in a minute."
 He started parting his hair all over again. It took him about an hour to comb his
hair.
 "Her mother and father were divorced. Her mother was married again to some
booze hound," I said. "Skinny guy with hairy legs. I remember him. He wore shorts all
the time. Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing, but all I
ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery
program on the radio. And run around the goddam house, naked. With Jane around, and
all."
 "Yeah?" Stradlater said. That really interested him. About the booze hound
running around the house naked, with Jane around. Stradlater was a very sexy bastard.
 "She had a lousy childhood. I'm not kidding."
 That didn't interest Stradlater, though. Only very sexy stuff interested him.
 "Jane Gallagher. Jesus . . . I couldn't get her off my mind. I really couldn't. "I
oughta go down and say hello to her, at least."
 "Why the hell don'tcha, instead of keep saying it?" Stradlater said.
 I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from
all the heat in the can.. "I'm not in the mood right now," I said. I wasn't, either. You have
to be in the mood for those things. "I thought she went to Shipley. I could've sworn she
went to Shipley." I walked around the can for a little while. I didn't have anything else to
do. "Did she enjoy the game?" I said.
 "Yeah, I guess so. I don't know."
 "Did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time, or anything?"
 "I don't know. For Chrissake, I only just met her," Stradlater said. He was finished
combing his goddam gorgeous hair. He was putting away all his crumby toilet articles.
 "Listen. Give her my regards, willya?"
 "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he probably wouldn't. You take a guy like
Stradlater, they never give your regards to people.
 He went back to the room, but I stuck around in the can for a while, thinking
about old Jane. Then I went back to the room, too.
 Stradlater was putting on his tie, in front of the mirror, when I got there. He spent
around half his goddam life in front of the mirror. I sat down in my chair and sort of
watched him for a while.
 "Hey," I said. "Don't tell her I got kicked out, willya?"
 "Okay."
 That was one good thing about Stradlater. You didn't have to explain every
goddam little thing with him, the way you had to do with Ackley. Mostly, I guess,
because he wasn't too interested. That's really why. Ackley, it was different. Ackley was
a very nosy bastard.
 He put on my hound's-tooth jacket. 
 "Jesus, now, try not to stretch it all over the place" I said. I'd only worn it about
twice.
 "I won't. Where the hell's my cigarettes?"
 "On the desk." He never knew where he left anything. "Under your muffler." He
put them in his coat pocket--my coat pocket.
 I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a
change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I'm quite a nervous guy. "Listen,
where ya going on your date with her?" I asked him. "Ya know yet?"
 "I don't know. New York, if we have time. She only signed out for nine-thirty, for
Chrissake."
 I didn't like the way he said it, so I said, "The reason she did that, she probably
just didn't know what a handsome, charming bastard you are. If she'd known, she
probably would've signed out for nine-thirty in the morning."
 "Goddam right," Stradlater said. You couldn't rile him too easily. He was too
conceited. "No kidding, now. Do that composition for me," he said. He had his coat on,
and he was all ready to go. "Don't knock yourself out or anything, but just make it
descriptive as hell. Okay?"
 I didn't answer him. I didn't feel like it. All I said was, "Ask her if she still keeps
all her kings in the back row."
 "Okay," Stradlater said, but I knew he wouldn't. "Take it easy, now." He banged
the hell out of the room.
 I sat there for about a half hour after he left. I mean I just sat in my chair, not
doing anything. I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date with her
and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you what a sexy bastard
Stradlater was.
 All of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains,
as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind off the
other stuff.
 He stuck around till around dinnertime, talking about all the guys at Pencey that
he hated their guts, and squeezing this big pimple on his chin. He didn't even use his
handkerchief. I don't even think the bastard had a handkerchief, if you want to know the
truth. I never saw him use one, anyway.
5
 We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to
be a big deal, because they gave you steak. I'll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did
that was because a lot of guys' parents came up to school on Sunday, and old Thurmer
probably figured everybody's mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner
last night, and he'd say, "Steak." What a racket. You should've seen the steaks. They were
these little hard, dry jobs that you could hardly even cut. You always got these very
lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert you got Brown Betty, which
nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didn't know any better--
and guys like Ackley that ate everything. 
 It was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three
inches of snow on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked
pretty as hell, and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the
place. It was very childish, but everybody was really enjoying themselves.
 I didn't have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that
was on the wrestling team, decided we'd take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger
and maybe see a lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night. I
asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us. The reason I asked was because
Ackley never did anything on Saturday night, except stay in his room and squeeze his
pimples or something. Mal said he didn't mind but that he wasn't too crazy about the idea.
He didn't like Ackley much. Anyway, we both went to our rooms to get ready and all,
and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap, I yelled over and asked old Ackley if
he wanted to go to the movies. He could hear me all right through the shower curtains,
but he didn't answer me right away. He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you
right away. Finally he came over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the shower
ledge and asked who was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I
swear, if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat,
he'd want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he'd even get in. I told him
Mal Brossard was going. He said, "That bastard . . . All right. Wait a second." You'd
think he was doing you a big favor.
 It took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing it, I went over to
my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands. The snow was
very good for packing. I didn't throw it at anything, though. I started to throw it. At a car
that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind. The car looked so nice and
white. Then I started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and white, too.
Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did was close the window and walk around the
room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had it with me when
I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus. The bus driver opened the doors and made me
throw it out. I told him I wasn't going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't believe me.
People never believe you.
 Brossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing, so all we did, we
just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while, then
took the bus back to Pencey. I didn't care about not seeing the movie, anyway. It was
supposed to be a comedy, with Cary Grant in it, and all that crap. Besides, I'd been to the
movies with Brossard and Ackley before. They both laughed like hyenas at stuff that
wasn't even funny. I didn't even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies.
 It was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm. Old Brossard
was a bridge fiend, and he started looking around the dorm for a game. Old Ackley
parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of
Stradlater's chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all. He
started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I dropped
about a thousand hints, but I couldn't get rid of him. All he did was keep talking in this
very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse
with the summer before. He'd already told me about it about a hundred times. Every time
he told it, it was different. One minute he'd be giving it to her in his cousin's Buick, the
next minute he'd be giving it to her under some boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap, 
naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel.
Anyway, finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for
Stradlater, and that he had to clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but
he took his time about it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and
my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition.
 The thing was, I couldn't think of a room or a house or anything to describe the
way Stradlater said he had to have. I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and houses
anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It was a very
descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder's mitt. He
was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems
written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them
on it so that he'd have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at
bat. He's dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18,
1946. You'd have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty
times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing
letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their
class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that
he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways.
He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily,
but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair he had. I
started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the summer I was
around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a
sudden, I'd see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his bike outside the
fence--there was this fence that went all around the course--and he was sitting there,
about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off. That's the kind of red
hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he
thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair. I was only thirteen, and
they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in
the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I
broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all
the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken
and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll
admit, but I hardly didn't even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie. My hand
still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist any more--
not a tight one, I mean--but outside of that I don't care much. I mean I'm not going to be a
goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway.
 Anyway, that's what I wrote Stradlater's composition about. Old Allie's baseball
mitt. I happened to have it with me, in my suitcase, so I got it out and copied down the
poems that were written on it. All I had to do was change Allie's name so that nobody
would know it was my brother and not Stradlater's. I wasn't too crazy about doing it, but I
couldn't think of anything else descriptive. Besides, I sort of liked writing about it. It took
me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater's lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming
on me. The reason I didn't use my own was because I'd lent it to a guy down the hall.
 It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it. I wasn't tired, though, so I
looked out the window for a while. It wasn't snowing out any more, but every once in a
while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started. You could also hear 
old Ackley snoring. Right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him. He
had sinus trouble and he couldn't breathe too hot when he was asleep. That guy had just
about everything. Sinus trouble, pimples, lousy teeth, halitosis, crumby fingernails. You
had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch.
6
 Some things are hard to remember. I'm thinking now of when Stradlater got back
from his date with Jane. I mean I can't remember exactly what I was doing when I heard
his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor. I probably was still looking out
the window, but I swear I can't remember. I was so damn worried, that's why. When I
really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom
when I worry about something. Only, I don't go. I'm too worried to go. I don't want to
interrupt my worrying to go. If you knew Stradlater, you'd have been worried, too. I'd
double-dated with that bastard a couple of times, and I know what I'm talking about. He
was unscrupulous. He really was.
 Anyway, the corridor was all linoleum and all, and you could hear his goddam
footsteps coming right towards the room. I don't even remember where I was sitting when
he came in--at the window, or in my chair or his. I swear I can't remember.
 He came in griping about how cold it was out. Then he said, "Where the hell is
everybody? It's like a goddam morgue around here." I didn't even bother to answer him.
If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody was out or
asleep or home for the week end, I wasn't going to break my neck telling him. He started
getting undressed. He didn't say one goddam word about Jane. Not one. Neither did I. I
just watched him. All he did was thank me for letting him wear my hound's-tooth. He
hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet.
 Then when he was taking off his tie, he asked me if I'd written his goddam
composition for him. I told him it was over on his goddam bed. He walked over and read
it while he was unbuttoning his shirt. He stood there, reading it, and sort of stroking his
bare chest and stomach, with this very stupid expression on his face. He was always
stroking his stomach or his chest. He was mad about himself.
 All of a sudden, he said, "For Chrissake, Holden. This is about a goddam baseball
glove."
 "So what?" I said. Cold as hell.
 "Wuddaya mean so what? I told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house
or something."
 "You said it had to be descriptive. What the hell's the difference if it's about a
baseball glove?"
 "God damn it." He was sore as hell. He was really furious. "You always do
everything backasswards." He looked at me. "No wonder you're flunking the hell out of
here," he said. "You don't do one damn thing the way you're supposed to. I mean it. Not
one damn thing."
 "All right, give it back to me, then," I said. I went over and pulled it right out of
his goddam hand. Then I tore it up.
 "What the hellja do that for?" he said. 
 I didn't even answer him. I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket. Then I lay
down on my bed, and we both didn't say anything for a long time. He got all undressed,
down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren't allowed to smoke
in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and
nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater. It drove him crazy
when you broke any rules. He never smoked in the dorm. It was only me.
 He still didn't say one single solitary word about Jane. So finally I said, "You're
back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine-thirty. Did you make her be late
signing in?"
 He was sitting on the edge of his bed, cutting his goddam toenails, when I asked
him that. "Coupla minutes," he said. "Who the hell signs out for nine-thirty on a Saturday
night?" God, how I hated him.
 "Did you go to New York?" I said.
 "Ya crazy? How the hell could we go to New York if she only signed out for
nine-thirty?"
 "That's tough."
 He looked up at me. "Listen," he said, "if you're gonna smoke in the room, how
'bout going down to the can and do it? You may be getting the hell out of here, but I have
to stick around long enough to graduate."
 I ignored him. I really did. I went right on smoking like a madman. All I did was
sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails. What a school. You
were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or
something.
 "Did you give her my regards?" I asked him.
 "Yeah."
 The hell he did, the bastard.
 "What'd she say?" I said. "Did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the
back row?"
 "No, I didn't ask her. What the hell ya think we did all night--play checkers, for
Chrissake?"
 I didn't even answer him. God, how I hated him.
 "If you didn't go to New York, where'd ya go with her?" I asked him, after a little
while. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place. Boy, was I getting
nervous. I just had a feeling something had gone funny.
 He was finished cutting his damn toenails. So he got up from the bed, in just his
damn shorts and all, and started getting very damn playful. He came over to my bed and
started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder. "Cut it
out," I said. "Where'd you go with her if you didn't go to New York?"
 "Nowhere. We just sat in the goddam car." He gave me another one of those
playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder.
 "Cut it out," I said. "Whose car?"
 "Ed Banky's."
 Ed Banky was the basketball coach at Pencey. Old Stradlater was one of his pets,
because he was the center on the team, and Ed Banky always let him borrow his car when
he wanted it. It wasn't allowed for students to borrow faculty guys' cars, but all the 
athletic bastards stuck together. In every school I've gone to, all the athletic bastards stick
together.
 Stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder. He had his
toothbrush in his hand, and he put it in his mouth. "What'd you do?" I said. "Give her the
time in Ed Banky's goddam car?" My voice was shaking something awful.
 "What a thing to say. Want me to wash your mouth out with soap?"
 "Did you?"
 "That's a professional secret, buddy."
 This next part I don't remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like I
was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might,
right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I
didn't connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It
probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably would've hurt him
a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can't make a good fist with that hand. On
account of that injury I told you about.
 Anyway, the next thing I knew, I was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on
my chest, with his face all red. That is, he had his goddam knees on my chest, and he
weighed about a ton. He had hold of my wrists, too, so I couldn't take another sock at
him. I'd've killed him.
 "What the hell's the matter with you?" he kept saying, and his stupid race kept
getting redder and redder.
 "Get your lousy knees off my chest," I told him. I was almost bawling. I really
was. "Go on, get off a me, ya crumby bastard."
 He wouldn't do it, though. He kept holding onto my wrists and I kept calling him
a sonuvabitch and all, for around ten hours. I can hardly even remember what all I said to
him. I told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like. I told him he
didn't even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not, and the reason he didn't
care was because he was a goddam stupid moron. He hated it when you called a moron.
All morons hate it when you call them a moron.
 "Shut up, now, Holden," he said with his big stupid red face. "just shut up, now."
 "You don't even know if her first name is Jane or Jean, ya goddam moron!"
 "Now, shut up, Holden, God damn it--I'm warning ya," he said--I really had him
going. "If you don't shut up, I'm gonna slam ya one."
 "Get your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest."
 "If I letcha up, will you keep your mouth shut?"
 I didn't even answer him.
 He said it over again. "Holden. If I letcha up, willya keep your mouth shut?"
 "Yes."
 He got up off me, and I got up, too. My chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees.
"You're a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron," I told him.
 That got him really mad. He shook his big stupid finger in my face. "Holden, God
damn it, I'm warning you, now. For the last time. If you don't keep your yap shut, I'm
gonna--"
 "Why should I?" I said--I was practically yelling. "That's just the trouble with all
you morons. You never want to discuss anything. That's the way you can always tell a
moron. They never want to discuss anything intellig--

Then he really let one go at me, and the next thing I knew I was on the goddam
floor again. I don't remember if he knocked me out or not, but I don't think so. It's pretty
hard to knock a guy out, except in the goddam movies. But my nose was bleeding all
over the place. When I looked up old Stradlater was standing practically right on top of
me. He had his goddam toilet kit under his arm. "Why the hell don'tcha shut up when I
tellya to?" he said. He sounded pretty nervous. He probably was scared he'd fractured my
skull or something when I hit the floor. It's too bad I didn't. "You asked for it, God damn
it," he said. Boy, did he look worried.
 I didn't even bother to get up. I just lay there in the floor for a while, and kept
calling him a moron sonuvabitch. I was so mad, I was practically bawling.
 "Listen. Go wash your face," Stradlater said. "Ya hear me?"
 I told him to go wash his own moron face--which was a pretty childish thing to
say, but I was mad as hell. I told him to stop off on the way to the can and give Mrs.
Schmidt the time. Mrs. Schmidt was the janitor's wife. She was around sixty-five.
 I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go
down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn't find my goddam hunting hat
anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the old peak
around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I went over and took a look at my stupid
face in the mirror. You never saw such gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth
and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe. It partly scared me and it partly
fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough. I'd only been in about
two fights in my life, and I lost both of them. I'm not too tough. I'm a pacifist, if you want
to know the truth.
 I had a feeling old Ackley'd probably heard all the racket and was awake. So I
went through the shower curtains into his room, just to see what the hell he was doing. I
hardly ever went over to his room. It always had a funny stink in it, because he was so
crumby in his personal habits.
7
 A tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room, and I
could see him lying in bed. I knew damn well he was wide awake. "Ackley?" I said.
"Y'awake?"
 "Yeah."
 It was pretty dark, and I stepped on somebody's shoe on the floor and danm near
fell on my head. Ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm. He had a lot of white
stuff on his face, for his pimples. He looked sort of spooky in the dark. "What the hellya
doing, anyway?" I said.
 "Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing? I was tryna sleep before you guys
started making all that noise. What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?"
 "Where's the light?" I couldn't find the light. I was sliding my hand all over the
wall.
 "Wuddaya want the light for? . . . Right next to your hand."
 I finally found the switch and turned It on. Old Ackley put his hand up so the light
wouldn't hurt his eyes. 
 "Jesus!" he said. "What the hell happened to you?" He meant all the blood and all.
 "I had a little goddam tiff with Stradlater," I said. Then I sat down on the floor.
They never had any chairs in their room. I don't know what the hell they did with their
chairs. "Listen," I said, "do you feel like playing a little Canasta?" He was a Canasta
fiend.
 "You're still bleeding, for Chrissake. You better put something on it."
 "It'll stop. Listen. Ya wanna play a little Canasta or don'tcha?"
 "Canasta, for Chrissake. Do you know what time it is, by any chance?"
 "It isn't late. It's only around eleven, eleven-thirty."
 "Only around!" Ackley said. "Listen. I gotta get up and go to Mass in the
morning, for Chrissake. You guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the
goddam--What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?"
 "It's a long story. I don't wanna bore ya, Ackley. I'm thinking of your welfare," I
told him. I never discussed my personal life with him. In the first place, he was even
more stupid than Stradlater. Stradlater was a goddam genius next to Ackley. "Hey," I
said, "is it okay if I sleep in Ely's bed tonight? He won't be back till tomorrow night, will
he?" I knew damn well he wouldn't. Ely went home damn near every week end.
 "I don't know when the hell he's coming back," Ackley said.
 Boy, did that annoy me. "What the hell do you mean you don't know when he's
coming back? He never comes back till Sunday night, does he?"
 "No, but for Chrissake, I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam
bed if they want to."
 That killed me. I reached up from where I was sitting on the floor and patted him
on the goddam shoulder. "You're a prince, Ackley kid," I said. "You know that?"
 "No, I mean it--I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in--"
 "You're a real prince. You're a gentleman and a scholar, kid," I said. He really
was, too. "Do you happen to have any cigarettes, by any chance?--Say 'no' or I'll drop
dead."
 "No, I don't, as a matter of fact. Listen, what the hell was the fight about?"
 I didn't answer him. All I did was, I got up and went over and looked out the
window. I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden. I almost wished I was dead.
 "What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?" Ackley said, for about the fiftieth
time. He certainly was a bore about that.
 "About you," I said.
 "About me, for Chrissake?"
 "Yeah. I was defending your goddam honor. Stradlater said you had a lousy
personality. I couldn't let him get away with that stuff."
 That got him excited. "He did? No kidding? He did?"
 I told him I was only kidding, and then I went over and laid down on Ely's bed.
Boy, did I feel rotten. I felt so damn lonesome.
 "This room stinks," I said. "I can smell your socks from way over here. Don'tcha
ever send them to the laundry?"
 "If you don't like it, you know what you can do," Ackley said. What a witty guy.
"How 'bout turning off the goddam light?"
 I didn't turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely's bed,
thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her 
and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky's car. Every time I thought
about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you didn't know Stradlater. I
knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all
the time--like Ackley, for instance--but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally
acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That's the truth.
 "Tell me the story of your fascinating life, Ackley kid," I said.
 "How 'bout turning off the goddam light? I gotta get up for Mass in the morning."
 I got up and turned it off, if it made him happy. Then I laid down on Ely's bed
again.
 "What're ya gonna do--sleep in Ely's bed?" Ackley said. He was the perfect host,
boy.
 "I may. I may not. Don't worry about it."
 "I'm not worried about it. Only, I'd hate like hell if Ely came in all of a sudden and
found some guy--"
 "Relax. I'm not gonna sleep here. I wouldn't abuse your goddam hospitality."
 A couple of minutes later, he was snoring like mad. I kept laying there in the dark
anyway, though, trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam Ed
Banky's car. But it was almost impossible. The trouble was, I knew that guy Stradlater's
technique. That made it even worse. We once double-dated, in Ed Banky's car, and
Stradlater was in the back, with his date, and I was in the front with mine. What a
technique that guy had. What he'd do was, he'd start snowing his date in this very quiet,
sincere voice--like as if he wasn't only a very handsome guy but a nice, sincere guy, too. I
damn near puked, listening to him. His date kept saying, "No--please. Please, don't.
Please." But old Stradlater kept snowing her in this Abraham Lincoln, sincere voice, and
finally there'd be this terrific silence in the back of the car. It was really embarrassing. I
don't think he gave that girl the time that night--but damn near. Damn near.
 While I was laying there trying not to think, I heard old Stradlater come back
from the can and go in our room. You could hear him putting away his crumby toilet
articles and all, and opening the window. He was a fresh-air fiend. Then, a little while
later, he turned off the light. He didn't even look around to see where I was at.
 It was even depressing out in the street. You couldn't even hear any cars any
more. I got feeling so lonesome and rotten, I even felt like waking Ackley up.
 "Hey, Ackley," I said, in sort of a whisper, so Stradlater couldn't hear me through
the shower curtain.
 Ackley didn't hear me, though.
 "Hey, Ackley!"
 He still didn't hear me. He slept like a rock.
 "Hey, Ackley!"
 He heard that, all right.
 "What the hell's the matter with you?" he said. "I was asleep, for Chrissake."
 "Listen. What's the routine on joining a monastery?" I asked him. I was sort of
toying with the idea of joining one. "Do you have to be a Catholic and all?"
 "Certainly you have to be a Catholic. You bastard, did you wake me just to ask
me a dumb ques--" 
 "Aah, go back to sleep. I'm not gonna join one anyway. The kind of luck I have,
I'd probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it. All stupid bastards. Or just
bastards."
 When I said that, old Ackley sat way the hell up in bed. "Listen," he said, "I don't
care what you say about me or anything, but if you start making cracks about my goddam
religion, for Chrissake--"
 "Relax," I said. "Nobody's making any cracks about your goddam religion." I got
up off Ely's bed, and started towards the door. I didn't want to hang around in that stupid
atmosphere any more. I stopped on the way, though, and picked up Ackley's hand, and
gave him a big, phony handshake. He pulled it away from me. "What's the idea?" he said.
 "No idea. I just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince, that's all," I
said. I said it in this very sincere voice. "You're aces, Ackley kid," I said. "You know
that?"
 "Wise guy. Someday somebody's gonna bash your--"
 I didn't even bother to listen to him. I shut the damn door and went out in the
corridor.
 Everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end, and it was very, very
quiet and depressing in the corridor. There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste
outside Leahy and Hoffman's door, and while I walked down towards the stairs, I kept
giving it a boot with this sheep-lined slipper I had on. What I thought I'd do, I thought I
might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing. But all of a sudden, I changed
my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do, I'd get the hell out of Pencey--
right that same night and all. I mean not wait till Wednesday or anything. I just didn't
want to hang around any more. It made me too sad and lonesome. So what I decided to
do, I decided I'd take a room in a hotel in New York--some very inexpensive hotel and
all--and just take it easy till Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I'd go home all rested up
and feeling swell. I figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying
I'd been given the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I didn't want to go home or
anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all. I didn't want to be around
when they first got it. My mother gets very hysterical. She's not too bad after she gets
something thoroughly digested, though. Besides, I sort of needed a little vacation. My
nerves were shot. They really were.
 Anyway, that's what I decided I'd do. So I went back to the room and turned on
the light, to start packing and all. I already had quite a few things packed. Old Stradlater
didn't even wake up. I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I packed these two
Gladstones I have. It only took me about two minutes. I'm a very rapid packer.
 One thing about packing depressed me a little. I had to pack these brand-new ice
skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before. That depressed
me. I could see my mother going in Spaulding's and asking the salesman a million dopy
questions--and here I was getting the ax again. It made me feel pretty sad. She bought me
the wrong kind of skates--I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey--but it made me
sad anyway. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad.
 After I got all packed, I sort of counted my dough. I don't remember exactly how
much I had, but I was pretty loaded. My grandmother'd just sent me a wad about a week
before. I have this grandmother that's quite lavish with her dough. She doesn't have all
her marbles any more--she's old as hell--and she keeps sending me money for my 
birthday about four times a year. Anyway, even though I was pretty loaded, I figured I
could always use a few extra bucks. You never know. So what I did was, I went down the
hail and woke up Frederick Woodruff, this guy I'd lent my typewriter to. I asked him how
much he'd give me for it. He was a pretty wealthy guy. He said he didn't know. He said
he didn't much want to buy it. Finally he bought it, though. It cost about ninety bucks,
and all he bought it for was twenty. He was sore because I'd woke him up.
 When I was all set to go, when I had my bags and all, I stood for a while next to
the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor. I was sort of crying. I don't
know why. I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the back, the way I
liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, "Sleep tight, ya morons!" I'll bet
I woke up every bastard on the whole floor. Then I got the hell out. Some stupid guy had
thrown peanut shells all over the stairs, and I damn near broke my crazy neck.
8
 It was too late to call up for a cab or anything, so I walked the whole way to the
station. It wasn't too far, but it was cold as hell, and the snow made it hard for walking,
and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs. I sort of enjoyed the air and all,
though. The only trouble was, the cold made my nose hurt, and right under my upper lip,
where old Stradlater'd laid one on me. He'd smacked my lip right on my teeth, and it was
pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though. That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and
I put them on--I didn't give a damn how I looked. Nobody was around anyway.
Everybody was in the sack.
 I was quite lucky when I got to the station, because I only had to wait about ten
minutes for a train. While I waited, I got some snow in my hand and washed my face
with it. I still had quite a bit of blood on.
 Usually I like riding on trains, especially at night, with the lights on and the
windows so black, and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and
sandwiches and magazines. I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines. If
I'm on a train at night, I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine
without puking. You know. One of those stories with a lot of phony, lean-jawed guys
named David in it, and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia that are always
lighting all the goddam Davids' pipes for them. I can even read one of those lousy stories
on a train at night, usually. But this time, it was different. I just didn't feel like it. I just
sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my
pocket.
 All of a sudden, this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me. Practically
the whole car was empty, because it was pretty late and all, but she sat down next to me,
instead of an empty seat, because she had this big bag with her and I was sitting in the
front seat. She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle, where the conductor and
everybody could trip over it. She had these orchids on, like she'd just been to a big party
or something. She was around forty or forty-five, I guess, but she was very good looking.
Women kill me. They really do. I don't mean I'm oversexed or anything like that--
although I am quite sexy. I just like them, I mean. They're always leaving their goddam
bags out in the middle of the aisle. 
 Anyway, we were sitting there, and all of a sudden she said to me, "Excuse me,
but isn't that a Pencey Prep sticker?" She was looking up at my suitcases, up on the rack.
 "Yes, it is," I said. She was right. I did have a goddam Pencey sticker on one of
my Gladstones. Very corny, I'll admit.
 "Oh, do you go to Pencey?" she said. She had a nice voice. A nice telephone
voice, mostly. She should've carried a goddam telephone around with her.
 "Yes, I do," I said.
 "Oh, how lovely! Perhaps you know my son, then, Ernest Morrow? He goes to
Pencey."
 "Yes, I do. He's in my class."
 Her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to Pencey, in the whole
crumby history of the school. He was always going down the corridor, after he'd had a
shower, snapping his soggy old wet towel at people's asses. That's exactly the kind of a
guy he was.
 "Oh, how nice!" the lady said. But not corny. She was just nice and all. "I must
tell Ernest we met," she said. "May I ask your name, dear?"
 "Rudolf Schmidt," I told her. I didn't feel like giving her my whole life history.
Rudolf Schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm.
 "Do you like Pencey?" she asked me.
 "Pencey? It's not too bad. It's not paradise or anything, but it's as good as most
schools. Some of the faculty are pretty conscientious."
 "Ernest just adores it."
 "I know he does," I said. Then I started shooting the old crap around a little bit.
"He adapts himself very well to things. He really does. I mean he really knows how to
adapt himself."
 "Do you think so?" she asked me. She sounded interested as hell.
 "Ernest? Sure," I said. Then I watched her take off her gloves. Boy, was she lousy
with rocks.
 "I just broke a nail, getting out of a cab," she said. She looked up at me and sort of
smiled. She had a terrifically nice smile. She really did. Most people have hardly any
smile at all, or a lousy one. "Ernest's father and I sometimes worry about him," she said.
"We sometimes feel he's not a terribly good mixer."
 "How do you mean?"
 "Well. He's a very sensitive boy. He's really never been a terribly good mixer with
other boys. Perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age."
 Sensitive. That killed me. That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam
toilet seat.
 I gave her a good look. She didn't look like any dope to me. She looked like she
might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of. But you can't
always tell--with somebody's mother, I mean. Mothers are all slightly insane. The thing
is, though, I liked old Morrow's mother. She was all right. "Would you care for a
cigarette?" I asked her.
 She looked all around. "I don't believe this is a smoker, Rudolf," she said. Rudolf.
That killed me.
 "That's all right. We can smoke till they start screaming at us," I said. She took a
cigarette off me, and I gave her a light. 
 She looked nice, smoking. She inhaled and all, but she didn't wolf the smoke
down, the way most women around her age do. She had a lot of charm. She had quite a
lot of sex appeal, too, if you really want to know.
 She was looking at me sort of funny. I may be wrong but I believe your nose is
bleeding, dear, she said, all of a sudden.
 I nodded and took out my handkerchief. "I got hit with a snowball," I said. "One
of those very icy ones." I probably would've told her what really happened, but it
would've taken too long. I liked her, though. I was beginning to feel sort of sorry I'd told
her my name was Rudolf Schmidt. "Old Ernie," I said. "He's one of the most popular
boys at Pencey. Did you know that?"
 "No, I didn't."
 I nodded. "It really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him. He's a
funny guy. A strange guy, in lots of ways--know what I mean? Like when I first met him.
When I first met him, I thought he was kind of a snobbish person. That's what I thought.
But he isn't. He's just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get
to know him."
 Old Mrs. Morrow didn't say anything, but boy, you should've seen her. I had her
glued to her seat. You take somebody's mother, all they want to hear about is what a hotshot their son is.
 Then I really started chucking the old crap around. "Did he tell you about the
elections?" I asked her. "The class elections?"
 She shook her head. I had her in a trance, like. I really did.
 "Well, a bunch of us wanted old Ernie to be president of the class. I mean he was
the unanimous choice. I mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job," I
said--boy, was I chucking it. "But this other boy--Harry Fencer--was elected. And the
reason he was elected, the simple and obvious reason, was because Ernie wouldn't let us
nominate him. Because he's so darn shy and modest and all. He refused. . . Boy, he's
really shy. You oughta make him try to get over that." I looked at her. "Didn't he tell you
about it?"
 "No, he didn't."
 I nodded. "That's Ernie. He wouldn't. That's the one fault with him--he's too shy
and modest. You really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally."
 Right that minute, the conductor came around for old Mrs. Morrow's ticket, and it
gave me a chance to quit shooting it. I'm glad I shot it for a while, though. You take a guy
like Morrow that's always snapping their towel at people's asses--really trying to hurt
somebody with it--they don't just stay a rat while they're a kid. They stay a rat their whole
life. But I'll bet, after all the crap I shot, Mrs. Morrow'll keep thinking of him now as this
very shy, modest guy that wouldn't let us nominate him for president. She might. You
can't tell. Mothers aren't too sharp about that stuff.
 "Would you care for a cocktail?" I asked her. I was feeling in the mood for one
myself. "We can go in the club car. All right?"
 "Dear, are you allowed to order drinks?" she asked me. Not snotty, though. She
was too charming and all to be snotty.
 "Well, no, not exactly, but I can usually get them on account of my heighth," I
said. "And I have quite a bit of gray hair." I turned sideways and showed her my gray 
hair. It fascinated hell out of her. "C'mon, join me, why don't you?" I said. I'd've enjoyed
having her.
 "I really don't think I'd better. Thank you so much, though, dear," she said.
"Anyway, the club car's most likely closed. It's quite late, you know." She was right. I'd
forgotten all about what time it was.
 Then she looked at me and asked me what I was afraid she was going to ask me.
"Ernest wrote that he'd be home on Wednesday, that Christmas vacation would start on
Wednesday," she said. "I hope you weren't called home suddenly because of illness in the
family." She really looked worried about it. She wasn't just being nosy, you could tell.
 "No, everybody's fine at home," I said. "It's me. I have to have this operation."
 "Oh! I'm so sorry," she said. She really was, too. I was right away sorry I'd said it,
but it was too late.
 "It isn't very serious. I have this tiny little tumor on the brain."
 "Oh, no!" She put her hand up to her mouth and all. "Oh, I'll be all right and
everything! It's right near the outside. And it's a very tiny one. They can take it out in
about two minutes."
 Then I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket. Just to stop lying. Once I
get started, I can go on for hours if I feel like it. No kidding. Hours.
 We didn't talk too much after that. She started reading this Vogue she had with
her, and I looked out the window for a while. She got off at Newark. She wished me a lot
of luck with the operation and all. She kept calling me Rudolf. Then she invited me to
visit Ernie during the summer, at Gloucester, Massachusetts. She said their house was
right on the beach, and they had a tennis court and all, but I just thanked her and told her I
was going to South America with my grandmother. Which was really a hot one, because
my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house, except maybe to go to a goddam
matinee or something. But I wouldn't visit that sonuvabitch Morrow for all the dough in
the world, even if I was desperate.

 The first thing I did when I got off at Penn Station, I went into this phone booth. I
felt like giving somebody a buzz. I left my bags right outside the booth so that I could
watch them, but as soon as I was inside, I couldn't think of anybody to call up. My
brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed around nine o'clock--
so I couldn't call her up. She wouldn't've cared if I'd woke her up, but the trouble was, she
wouldn't've been the one that answered the phone. My parents would be the ones. So that
was out. Then I thought of giving Jane Gallagher's mother a buzz, and find out when
Jane's vacation started, but I didn't feel like it. Besides, it was pretty late to call up. Then I
thought of calling this girl I used to go around with quite frequently, Sally Hayes,
because I knew her Christmas vacation had started already--she'd written me this long,
phony letter, inviting me over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all--
but I was afraid her mother'd answer the phone. Her mother knew my mother, and I could
picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New
York. Besides, I wasn't crazy about talking to old Mrs. Hayes on the phone. She once told
Sally I was wild. She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life. Then I thought of 
calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was there, Carl Luce, but I
didn't like him much. So I ended up not calling anybody. I came out of the booth, after
about twenty minutes or so, and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the
cabs are and got a cab.
 I'm so damn absent-minded, I gave the driver my regular address, just out of habit
and all--I mean I completely forgot I was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days
and not go home till vacation started. I didn't think of it till we were halfway through the
park. Then I said, "Hey, do you mind turning around when you get a chance? I gave you
the wrong address. I want to go back downtown."
 The driver was sort of a wise guy. "I can't turn around here, Mac. This here's a
one-way. I'll have to go all the way to Ninedieth Street now."
 I didn't want to start an argument. "Okay," I said. Then I thought of something, all
of a sudden. "Hey, listen," I said. "You know those ducks in that lagoon right near
Central Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you happen to know where they
go, the ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know, by any chance?" I
realized it was only one chance in a million.
 He turned around and looked at me like I was a madman. "What're ya tryna do,
bud?" he said. "Kid me?"
 "No--I was just interested, that's all."
 He didn't say anything more, so I didn't either. Until we came out of the park at
Ninetieth Street. Then he said, "All right, buddy. Where to?"
 "Well, the thing is, I don't want to stay at any hotels on the East Side where I
might run into some acquaintances of mine. I'm traveling incognito," I said. I hate saying
corny things like "traveling incognito." But when I'm with somebody that's corny, I
always act corny too. "Do you happen to know whose band's at the Taft or the New
Yorker, by any chance?"
 "No idear, Mac."
 "Well--take me to the Edmont then," I said. "Would you care to stop on the way
and join me for a cocktail? On me. I'm loaded."
 "Can't do it, Mac. Sorry." He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.
 We got to the Edmont Hotel, and I checked in. I'd put on my red hunting cap
when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn't
want to look like a screwball or something. Which is really ironic. I didn't know then that
the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons. Screwballs all over the place.
 They gave me this very crumby room, with nothing to look out of the window at
except the other side of the hotel. I didn't care much. I was too depressed to care whether
I had a good view or not. The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy
around sixty-five. He was even more depressing than the room was. He was one of those
bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness. I'd rather be
bald than do that. Anyway, what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty-five years old.
Carrying people's suitcases and waiting around for a tip. I suppose he wasn't too
intelligent or anything, but it was terrible anyway.
 After he left, I looked out the window for a while, with my coat on and all. I didn't
have anything else to do. You'd be surprised what was going on on the other side of the
hotel. They didn't even bother to pull their shades down. I saw one guy, a gray-haired,
very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn't 
believe me if I told you. First he put his suitcase on the bed. Then he took out all these
women's clothes, and put them on. Real women's clothes--silk stockings, high-heeled
shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all. Then he
put on this very tight black evening dress. I swear to God. Then he started walking up and
down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a
cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror. He was all alone, too. Unless somebody
was in the bathroom--I couldn't see that much. Then, in the window almost right over his,
I saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other. It probably
was highballs, not water, but I couldn't see what they had in their glasses. Anyway, first
he'd take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him--they took turns, for
God's sake. You should've seen them. They were in hysterics the whole time, like it was
the funniest thing that ever happened. I'm not kidding, the hotel was lousy with perverts. I
was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place--and that isn't saying much. I
damn near sent a telegram to old Stradlater telling him to take the first train to New York.
He'd have been the king of the hotel.
 The trouble was, that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you don't
want it to be. For instance, that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face, she
was pretty good-looking. I mean that's my big trouble. In my mind, I'm probably the
biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff I wouldn't
mind doing if the opportunity came up. I can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun,
in a crumby way, and if you were both sort of drunk and all, to get a girl and squirt water
or something all over each other's face. The thing is, though, I don't like the idea. It
stinks, if you analyze it. I think if you don't really like a girl, you shouldn't horse around
with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you
like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water
all over it. It's really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes. Girls
aren't too much help, either, when you start trying not to get too crumby, when you start
trying not to spoil anything really good. I knew this one girl, a couple of years ago, that
was even crumbier than I was. Boy, was she crumby! We had a lot of fun, though, for a
while, in a crumby way. Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never
know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I
break them right away. Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing around
with girls that, deep down, gave me a pain in the ass. I broke it, though, the same week I
made it--the same night, as a matter of fact. I spent the whole night necking with a
terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman. Sex is something I just don't understand. I
swear to God I don't.
 I started toying with the idea, while I kept standing there, of giving old Jane a
buzz--I mean calling her long distance at B.M., where she went, instead of calling up her
mother to find out when she was coming home. You weren't supposed to call students up
late at night, but I had it all figured out. I was going to tell whoever answered the phone
that I was her uncle. I was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and I
had to speak to her immediately. It would've worked, too. The only reason I didn't do it
was because I wasn't in the mood. If you're not in the mood, you can't do that stuff right.
 After a while I sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I was
feeling pretty horny. I have to admit it. Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea. I took out
my wallet and started looking for this address a guy I met at a party last summer, that 
went to Princeton, gave me. Finally I found it. It was all a funny color from my wallet,
but you could still read it. It was the address of this girl that wasn't exactly a whore or
anything but that didn't mind doing it once in a while, this Princeton guy told me. He
brought her to a dance at Princeton once, and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her.
She used to be a burlesque stripper or something. Anyway, I went over to the phone and
gave her a buzz. Her name was Faith Cavendish, and she lived at the Stanford Arms
Hotel on Sixty-fifth and Broadway. A dump, no doubt.
 For a while, I didn t think she was home or something. Nobody kept answering.
Then, finally, somebody picked up the phone.
 "Hello?" I said. I made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn't suspect my age
or anything. I have a pretty deep voice anyway.
 "Hello," this woman's voice said. None too friendly, either.
 "Is this Miss Faith Cavendish?"
 "Who's this?" she said. "Who's calling me up at this crazy goddam hour?"
 That sort of scared me a little bit. "Well, I know it's quite late," I said, in this very
mature voice and all. "I hope you'll forgive me, but I was very anxious to get in touch
with you." I said it suave as hell. I really did.
 "Who is this?" she said.
 "Well, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Eddie Birdsell's. He suggested that
if I were in town sometime, we ought to get together for a cocktail or two."
 "Who? You're a friend of who?" Boy, she was a real tigress over the phone. She
was damn near yelling at me.
 "Edmund Birdsell. Eddie Birdsell," I said. I couldn't remember if his name was
Edmund or Edward. I only met him once, at a goddam stupid party.
 "I don't know anybody by that name, Jack. And if you think I enjoy bein' woke up
in the middle--"
 "Eddie Birdsell? From Princeton?" I said.
 You could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all.
 "Birdsell, Birdsell. . . from Princeton.. . Princeton College?"
 "That's right," I said.
 "You from Princeton College?"
 "Well, approximately."
 "Oh. . . How is Eddie?" she said. "This is certainly a peculiar time to call a person
up, though. Jesus Christ."
 "He's fine. He asked to be remembered to you."
 "Well, thank you. Remember me to him," she said. "He's a grand person. What's
he doing now?" She was getting friendly as hell, all of a sudden.
 "Oh, you know. Same old stuff," I said. How the hell did I know what he was
doing? I hardly knew the guy. I didn't even know if he was still at Princeton. "Look," I
said. "Would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere?"
 "By any chance do you have any idea what time it is?" she said. "What's your
name, anyhow, may I ask?" She was getting an English accent, all of a sudden. "You
sound a little on the young side."
 I laughed. "Thank you for the compliment," I said-- suave as hell. "Holden
Caulfield's my name." I should've given her a phony name, but I didn't think of it. 
 "Well, look, Mr. Cawffle. I'm not in the habit of making engagements in the
middle of the night. I'm a working gal."
 "Tomorrow's Sunday," I told her.
 "Well, anyway. I gotta get my beauty sleep. You know how it is."
 "I thought we might have just one cocktail together. It isn't too late."
 "Well. You're very sweet," she said. "Where ya callin' from? Where ya at now,
anyways?"
 "Me? I'm in a phone booth."
 "Oh," she said. Then there was this very long pause. "Well, I'd like awfully to get
together with you sometime, Mr. Cawffle. You sound very attractive. You sound like a
very attractive person. But it is late."
 "I could come up to your place."
 "Well, ordinary, I'd say grand. I mean I'd love to have you drop up for a cocktail,
but my roommate happens to be ill. She's been laying here all night without a wink of
sleep. She just this minute closed her eyes and all. I mean."
 "Oh. That's too bad."
 "Where ya stopping at? Perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow."
 "I can't make it tomorrow," I said. "Tonight's the only time I can make it." What a
dope I was. I shouldn't've said that.
 "Oh. Well, I'm awfully sorry."
 "I'll say hello to Eddie for you."
 "Willya do that? I hope you enjoy your stay in New York. It's a grand place."
 "I know it is. Thanks. Good night," I said. Then I hung up.
 Boy, I really fouled that up. I should've at least made it for cocktails or something.
10
 It was still pretty early. I'm not sure what time it was, but it wasn't too late. The
one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I'm not even tired. So I opened my suitcases and
took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt.
What I thought I'd do, I thought I'd go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in
the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel.
 While I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz,
though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and all. But
I couldn't take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little kid and she
wouldn't have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging
up if my parents answered, but that wouldn't've worked, either. They'd know it was me.
My mother always knows it's me. She's psychic. But I certainly wouldn't have minded
shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while.
 You should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole
life. She's really smart. I mean she's had all A's ever since she started school. As a matter
of fact, I'm the only dumb one in the family. My brother D.B.'s a writer and all, and my
brother Allie, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard. I'm the only really
dumb one. But you ought to see old Phoebe. She has this sort of red hair, a little bit like
Allie's was, that's very short in the summertime. In the summertime, she sticks it behind 
her ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the wintertime, it's pretty long, though.
Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn't. It's really nice, though. She's
only ten. She's quite skinny, like me, but nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her
once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and
that's what she is, roller-skate skinny. You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe
something, she knows exactly what the hell you're talking about. I mean you can even
take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's
a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie.
D.B. and I took her to see this French movie, The Baker's Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed
her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole
goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. When old Donat
comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away from the cops
and all, Phoebe'll say right out loud in the movie--right when the Scotch guy in the
picture says it--"Can you eat the herring?" She knows all the talk by heart. And when this
professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of
the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Phoebe beats him to it--she holds up
her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her.
The only trouble is, she's a little too affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a
child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she
doesn't finish them. They're all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield--only old
Phoebe spells it "Hazle." Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be
an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up. Her old man's always a "tall attractive
gentleman about 20 years of age." That kills me. Old Phoebe. I swear to God you'd like
her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny
little kid, I and Allie used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Allie had
this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to take old
Phoebe with us. She'd wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all.
And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general, old
Phoebe'd be listening. Sometimes you'd forget she was around, because she was such a
little kid, but she'd let you know. She'd interrupt you all the time. She'd give Allie or I a
push or something, and say, "Who? Who said that? Bobby or the lady?" And we'd tell her
who said it, and she'd say, "Oh," and go right on listening and all. She killed Allie, too. I
mean he liked her, too. She's ten now, and not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still
kills everybody--everybody with any sense, anyway.
 Anyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I
was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they'd find out I was in New York and
kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then I got all ready
and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on.
 Except for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the
lobby was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room, and
so I went in there. It wasn't very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table anyway--way in
the back. I should've waved a buck under the head-waiter's nose. In New York, boy,
money really talks--I'm not kidding.
 The band was putrid. Buddy Singer. Very brassy, but not good brassy--corny
brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody was
around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates. Except at 
the table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these three girls
around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the
kind of hats that you knew they didn't really live in New York, but one of them, the
blonde one, wasn't too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one, and I started giving her
the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for my order. I ordered a Scotch
and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw,
they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had
trouble with him anyway, though. "I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but do you have some
verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?"
 I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked
him, "Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?"
 "I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--"
 "Okay, okay," I said. I figured the hell with it. "Bring me a Coke." He started to
go away, but I called him back. "Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?" I asked
him. I asked him very nicely and all. "I can't sit in a corny place like this cold sober.
Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?"
 "I'm very sorry, sir. . ." he said, and beat it on me. I didn't hold it against him,
though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I'm a goddam minor.
 I started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the
blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn't do it crudely, though. I just
gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though, the three of
them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably thought I was too
young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of me-- you'd've thought I
wanted to marry them or something. I should've given them the freeze, after they did that,
but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing. I'm very fond of dancing, sometimes, and
that was one of the times. So all of a sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, "Would any
of you girls care to dance?" I didn't ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But
God damn it, they thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I'm
not kidding, they were three real morons. "C'mon," I said. "I'll dance with you one at a
time. All right? How 'bout it? C'mon!" I really felt like dancing.
 Finally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was
really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools nearly
had hysterics when we did. I certainly must've been very hard up to even bother with any
of them.
 But it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. She was one of the best dancers
I ever danced with. I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you
out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying to lead
you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay
at the table and just get drunk with her.
 "You really can dance," I told the blonde one. "You oughta be a pro. I mean it. I
danced with a pro once, and you're twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear of Marco
and Miranda?"
 "What?" she said. She wasn't even listening to me. She was looking all around the
place.
 "I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?"
 "I don't know. No. I don't know." 
 "Well, they're dancers, she's a dancer. She's not too hot, though. She does
everything she's supposed to, but she's not so hot anyway. You know when a girl's really
a terrific dancer?"
 "Wudga say?" she said. She wasn't listening to me, even. Her mind was
wandering all over the place.
 "I said do you know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?"
 "Uh-uh."
 "Well--where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn't anything
underneath my hand--no can, no legs, no feet, no anything--then the girl's really a terrific
dancer."
 She wasn't listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God,
could that dopey girl dance. Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing "Just One of
Those Things" and even they couldn't ruin it entirely. It's a swell song. I didn't try any
trick stuff while we danced--I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the
dance floor--but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed with me. The funny
thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden she came out with this very
dumb remark. "I and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre last night," she said. "The movie
actor. In person. He was buyin' a newspaper. He's cute."
 "You're lucky," I told her. "You're really lucky. You know that?" She was really a
moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the
top of her dopey head--you know-- right where the part is, and all. She got sore when I
did it.
 "Hey! What's the idea?"
 "Nothing. No idea. You really can dance," I said. "I have a kid sister that's only in
the goddam fourth grade. You're about as good as she is, and she can dance better than
anybody living or dead."
 "Watch your language, if you don't mind."
 What a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake.
 "Where you girls from?" I asked her.
 She didn't answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre to
show up, I guess.
 "Where you girls from?" I asked her again.
 "What?" she said.
 "Where you girls from? Don't answer if you don't feel like it. I don't want you to
strain yourself."
 "Seattle, Washington," she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me.
 "You're a very good conversationalist," I told her. "You know that?"
 "What?"
 I let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. "Do you feel like jitterbugging a little
bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything--just nice and easy.
Everybody'll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys and the fat guys,
and we'll have plenty of room. Okay?"
 "It's immaterial to me," she said. "Hey--how old are you, anyhow?"
 That annoyed me, for some reason. "Oh, Christ. Don't spoil it," I said. "I'm
twelve, for Chrissake. I'm big for my age." 
 "Listen. I toleja about that. I don't like that type language," she said. "If you're
gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know."
 I apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started
jitterbugging with me-- but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good. All
you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched
so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we
sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if
they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall half in love with
them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can
drive you crazy. They really can.
 They didn't invite me to sit down at their table-- mostly because they were too
ignorant--but I sat down anyway. The blonde I'd been dancing with's name was Bernice
something--Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones' names were Marty and Laverne. I told
them my name was Jim Steele, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to get them in a little
intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their arms.
You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three
of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of
goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They probably thought movie stars always
hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork Club
or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it took me about a half hour to find out where they all
worked and all in Seattle. They all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if
they liked it, but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three
dopes? I thought the two ugly ones, Marty and Laverne, were sisters, but they got very
insulted when I asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the
other one, and you couldn't blame them, but it was very amusing anyway.
 I danced with them all--the whole three of them--one at a time. The one ugly one,
Laverne, wasn't too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Marty, was murder. Old Marty
was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way I could even half
enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little. So I told her I just saw
Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor.
 "Where?" she asked me--excited as hell. "Where?"
 "Aw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn't you look when I told
you?"
 She practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody's heads to
see if she could see him. "Oh, shoot!" she said. I'd just about broken her heart-- I really
had. I was sorry as hell I'd kidded her. Some people you shouldn't kid, even if they
deserve it.
 Here's what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Marty
told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Laverne and Bernice
nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and asked Marty if
she'd seen him and all. Old Mart said she'd only caught a glimpse of him. That killed me.
 The bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick
before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was lousy
with glasses. The one ugly one, Laverne, kept kidding me because I was only drinking
Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Marty were drinking Tom
Collinses--in the middle of December, for God's sake. They didn't know any better. The 
blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water. She was really putting it away,
too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time. They hardly
talked--even to each other. Old Marty talked more than the other two. She kept saying
these very corny, boring things, like calling the can the "little girls' room," and she
thought Buddy Singer's poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood
up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks. She called his clarinet a "licorice stick." Was
she corny. The other ugly one, Laverne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept
asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking
me if my father had a date or not. Four times she asked me that--she was certainly witty.
Old Bernice, the blonde one, didn't say hardly anything at all. Every time I'd ask her
something, she said "What?" That can get on your nerves after a while.
 All of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me
and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see the first
show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a while, but they
wouldn't. So we said good-by and all. I told them I'd look them up in Seattle sometime, if
I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I mean.
 With cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they
should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them--I
wouldn't've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn't care much,
though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that
business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed
me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to
New York--from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake--and ends up getting up early in the
morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so
depressed I can't stand it. I'd've bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only
they hadn't told me that.
 I left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up
anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of those
places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with, or
unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn't any night club
in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get
drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks you out.
11
 All of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain
again. I got her on, and I couldn't get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in
the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam Ed Banky's car, and
though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadn't given her the time--I know old Jane
like a book--I still couldn't get her off my brain. I knew her like a book. I really did. I
mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of all athletic sports, and after I got to know
her, the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf
almost every afternoon. I really got to know her quite intimately. I don't mean it was
anything physical or anything--it wasn't--but we saw each other all the time. You don't
always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl. 
 The way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve
himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Jane's
mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that
kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her
stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived
in the house next to ours, but I'd never conversed with her before or anything. She gave
me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her
that I didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the
living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I
played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a
terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I
improved her game immensely, though. I'm a very good golfer. If I told you what I go
around in, you probably wouldn't believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I
changed my mind at the last minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much
as I do, I'd be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short.
 She was a funny girl, old Jane. I wouldn't exactly describe her as strictly beautiful.
She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she was
talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about fifty
directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all the way, her
mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got in her golf stance, or
when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and she read very good books.
She read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever
showed Allie's baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it. She'd never met Allie or
anything, because that was her first summer in Maine--before that, she went to Cape Cod-
-but I told her quite a lot about him. She was interested in that kind of stuff.
 My mother didn't like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Jane and
her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn't say hello. My
mother saw them in the village a lot, because Jane used to drive to market with her
mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn't think Jane was pretty,
even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that's all.
 I remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close
to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I was over at
her house, on the porch--they had this big screened-in porch. We were playing checkers. I
used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her kings out of the back row.
But I didn't kid her much, though. You never wanted to kid Jane too much. I think I really
like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a
funny thing. The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I
think they'd like it if you kidded them--in fact, I know they would--but it's hard to get
started, once you've known them a pretty long time and never kidded them. Anyway, I
was telling you about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking. It was raining like
hell and we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was
married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the house.
I didn't know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn't
talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy personality.
Anyway, old Jane wouldn't answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was
any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn't answer him. She didn't 
even look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked
Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn't even answer me, then. She made out like
she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this
tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares--boy, I can still see it.
She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don't know why, but it bothered hell
out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I
could sit down next to her--I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she
really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over--anywhere--her
eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears--her whole face except her
mouth and all. She sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest
we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and
white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I asked
her, on the way, if Mr. Cudahy--that was the booze hound's name--had ever tried to get
wise with her. She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure, and I wouldn't've put
it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never did find out what the hell was the
matter. Some girls you practically never find out what's the matter.
 I don't want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just
because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn't. I held hands with her all
the time, for instance. That doesn't sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold
hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or
else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid
they'd bore you or something. Jane was different. We'd get into a goddam movie or
something, and right away we'd start holding hands, and we wouldn't quit till the movie
was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it. You never
even worried, with Jane, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you
were happy. You really were.
 One other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something that
just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt
this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane's. It was a funny thing to do. I mean
she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back
of somebody's neck, they're around twenty-five or thirty and usually they're doing it to
their husband or their little kid--I do it to my kid sister Phoebe once in a while, for
instance. But if a girl's quite young and all and she does it, it's so pretty it just about kills
you.
 Anyway, that's what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair
in the lobby. Old Jane. Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater in that
damn Ed Banky's car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn't let him get to first
base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don't even like to talk about it, if you want
to know the truth.
 There was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking
blondes weren't around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the
place. It was too depressing. And I wasn't tired or anything. So I went up to my room and
put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in
action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down in the elevator again and got a
cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernie's. Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich
Village that my brother D.B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to 
Hollywood and prostituted himself. He used to take me with him once in a while. Ernie's
a big fat colored guy that plays the piano. He's a terrific snob and he won't hardly even
talk to you unless you're a big shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the
piano. He's so good he's almost corny, in fact. I don't exactly know what I mean by that,
but I mean it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his
goddam piano over. I think it's because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind
of guy that won't talk to you unless you're a big shot.
12
 The cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someone'd just tossed his
cookies in it. I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night. What
made it worse, it was so quiet and lonesome out, even though it was Saturday night. I
didn't see hardly anybody on the street. Now and then you just saw a man and a girl
crossing a street, with their arms around each other's waists and all, or a bunch of
hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates, all of them laughing like hyenas at something
you could bet wasn't funny. New York's terrible when somebody laughs on the street very
late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed. I
kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old Phoebe. But finally,
after I was riding a while, the cab driver and I sort of struck up a conversation. His name
was Horwitz. He was a much better guy than the other driver I'd had. Anyway, I thought
maybe he might know about the ducks.
 "Hey, Horwitz," I said. "You ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park? Down by
Central Park South?"
 "The what?"
 "The lagoon. That little lake, like, there. Where the ducks are. You know."
 "Yeah, what about it?"
 "Well, you know the ducks that swim around in it? In the springtime and all? Do
you happen to know where they go in the wintertime, by any chance?"
 "Where who goes?"
 "The ducks. Do you know, by any chance? I mean does somebody come around
in a truck or something and take them away, or do they fly away by themselves--go south
or something?"
 Old Horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me. He was a very
impatient-type guy. He wasn't a bad guy, though. "How the hell should I know?" he said.
"How the hell should I know a stupid thing like that?"
 "Well, don't get sore about it," I said. He was sore about it or something.
 "Who's sore? Nobody's sore."
 I stopped having a conversation with him, if he was going to get so damn touchy
about it. But he started it up again himself. He turned all the way around again, and said,
"The fish don't go no place. They stay right where they are, the fish. Right in the goddam
lake."
 "The fish--that's different. The fish is different. I'm talking about the ducks," I
said. 
 "What's different about it? Nothin's different about it," Horwitz said. Everything
he said, he sounded sore about something. "It's tougher for the fish, the winter and all,
than it is for the ducks, for Chrissake. Use your head, for Chrissake."
 I didn't say anything for about a minute. Then I said, "All right. What do they do,
the fish and all, when that whole little lake's a solid block of ice, people skating on it and
all?"
 Old Horwitz turned around again. "What the hellaya mean what do they do?" he
yelled at me. "They stay right where they are, for Chrissake."
 "They can't just ignore the ice. They can't just ignore it."
 "Who's ignoring it? Nobody's ignoring it!" Horwitz said. He got so damn excited
and all, I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something.
"They live right in the goddam ice. It's their nature, for Chrissake. They get frozen right
in one position for the whole winter."
 "Yeah? What do they eat, then? I mean if they're frozen solid, they can't swim
around looking for food and all."
 "Their bodies, for Chrissake--what'sa matter with ya? Their bodies take in
nutrition and all, right through the goddam seaweed and crap that's in the ice. They got
their pores open the whole time. That's their nature, for Chrissake. See what I mean?" He
turned way the hell around again to look at me.
 "Oh," I said. I let it drop. I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or
something. Besides, he was such a touchy guy, it wasn't any pleasure discussing anything
with him. "Would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere?" I said.
 He didn't answer me, though. I guess he was still thinking. I asked him again,
though. He was a pretty good guy. Quite amusing and all.
 "I ain't got no time for no liquor, bud," he said. "How the hell old are you,
anyways? Why ain'tcha home in bed?"
 "I'm not tired."
 When I got out in front of Ernie's and paid the fare, old Horwitz brought up the
fish again. He certainly had it on his mind. "Listen," he said. "If you was a fish, Mother
Nature'd take care of you, wouldn't she? Right? You don't think them fish just die when it
gets to be winter, do ya?"
 "No, but--"
 "You're goddam right they don't," Horwitz said, and drove off like a bat out of
hell. He was about the touchiest guy I ever met. Everything you said made him sore.
 Even though it was so late, old Ernie's was jampacked. Mostly with prep school
jerks and college jerks. Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for
Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it was so
crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Ernie was playing the piano. It was
supposed to be something holy, for God's sake, when he sat down at the piano. Nobody's
that good. About three couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and they were all
shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he played. He had a big
damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on him, so that everybody could
watch his face while he played. You couldn't see his fingers while he played--just his big
old face. Big deal. I'm not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing
when I came in, but whatever it was, he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these
dumb, show-offy ripples in the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives 
me a pain in the ass. You should've heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You
would've puked. They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like
hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn't funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or
an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I'd hate it. I wouldn't
even want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a piano
player, I'd play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody
was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very
phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides being a terrific
piano player. It was very phony--I mean him being such a big snob and all. In a funny
way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished. I don't even think he
knows any more when he's playing right or not. It isn't all his fault. I partly blame all
those dopes that clap their heads off--they'd foul up anybody, if you gave them a chance.
Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy again, and I damn near got my coat back
and went back to the hotel, but it was too early and I didn't feel much like being all alone.
 They finally got me this stinking table, right up against a wall and behind a
goddam post, where you couldn't see anything. It was one of those tiny little tables that if
the people at the next table don't get up to let you by--and they never do, the bastards--
you practically have to climb into your chair. I ordered a Scotch and soda, which is my
favorite drink, next to frozen Daiquiris. If you were only around six years old, you could
get liquor at Ernie's, the place was so dark and all, and besides, nobody cared how old
you were. You could even be a dope fiend and nobody'd care.
 I was surrounded by jerks. I'm not kidding. At this other tiny table, right to my
left, practically on top of me, there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-looking
girl. They were around my age, or maybe just a little older. It was funny. You could see
they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast. I listened to their
conversation for a while, because I didn't have anything else to do. He was telling her
about some pro football game he'd seen that afternoon. He gave her every single goddam
play in the whole game--I'm not kidding. He was the most boring guy I ever listened to.
And you could tell his date wasn't even interested in the goddam game, but she was even
funnier-looking than he was, so I guess she had to listen. Real ugly girls have it tough. I
feel so sorry for them sometimes. Sometimes I can't even look at them, especially if
they're with some dopey guy that's telling them all about a goddam football game. On my
right, the conversation was even worse, though. On my right there was this very Joe
Yale-looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests.
All those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go to Yale, or maybe
Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn't go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was dying,
for God's sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him.
Boy, she was good-looking. But you should've heard the conversation they were having.
In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was doing, he was giving her
a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that
had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide. His date kept saying to
him, "How horrible . . . Don't, darling. Please, don't. Not here." Imagine giving somebody
a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me.
 I certainly began to feel like a prize horse's ass, though, sitting there all by myself.
There wasn't anything to do except smoke and drink. What I did do, though, I told the
waiter to ask old Ernie if he'd care to join me for a drink. I told him to tell him I was 
D.B.'s brother. I don't think he ever even gave him my message, though. Those bastards
never give your message to anybody.
 All of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, "Holden Caulfield!" Her name
was Lillian Simmons. My brother D.B. used to go around with her for a while. She had
very big knockers.
 "Hi," I said. I tried to get up, naturally, but it was some job getting up, in a place
like that. She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass.
 "How marvelous to see you!" old Lillian Simmons said. Strictly a phony. "How's
your big brother?" That's all she really wanted to know.
 "He's fine. He's in Hollywood."
 "In Hollywood! How marvelous! What's he doing?"
 "I don't know. Writing," I said. I didn't feel like discussing it. You could tell she
thought it was a big deal, his being in Hollywood. Almost everybody does. Mostly people
who've never read any of his stories. It drives me crazy, though.
 "How exciting," old Lillian said. Then she introduced me to the Navy guy. His
name was Commander Blop or something. He was one of those guys that think they're
being a pansy if they don't break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with
you. God, I hate that stuff. "Are you all alone, baby?" old Lillian asked me. She was
blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle. You could tell she liked to block up a
lot of traffic. This waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way, but she didn't even
notice him. It was funny. You could tell the waiter didn't like her much, you could tell
even the Navy guy didn't like her much, even though he was dating her. And I didn't like
her much. Nobody did. You had to feel sort of sorry for her, in a way. "Don't you have a
date, baby?" she asked me. I was standing up now, and she didn't even tell me to sit
down. She was the type that keeps you standing up for hours. "Isn't he handsome?" she
said to the Navy guy. "Holden, you're getting handsomer by the minute." The Navy guy
told her to come on. He told her they were blocking up the whole aisle. "Holden, come
join us," old Lillian said. "Bring your drink."
 "I was just leaving," I told her. "I have to meet somebody." You could tell she was
just trying to get in good with me. So that I'd tell old D.B. about it.
 "Well, you little so-and-so. All right for you. Tell your big brother I hate him,
when you see him."
 Then she left. The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to've met each
other. Which always kills me. I'm always saying "Glad to've met you" to somebody I'm
not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though.
 After I'd told her I had to meet somebody, I didn't have any goddam choice except
to leave. I couldn't even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent.
But I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy
guy and be bored to death. So I left. It made me mad, though, when I was getting my
coat. People are always ruining things for you.
13
 I walked all the way back to the hotel. Forty-one gorgeous blocks. I didn't do it
because I felt like walking or anything. It was more because I didn't feel like getting in 
and out of another taxicab. Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way
you get tired riding in elevators. All of a sudden, you have to walk, no matter how far or
how high up. When I was a kid, I used to walk all the way up to our apartment very
frequently. Twelve stories.
 You wouldn't even have known it had snowed at all. There was hardly any snow
on the sidewalks. But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my
pocket and put it on--I didn't give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps down. I
wished I knew who'd swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were freezing. Not
that I'd have done much about it even if I had known. I'm one of these very yellow guys. I
try not to show it, but I am. For instance, if I'd found out at Pencey who'd stolen my
gloves, I probably would've gone down to the crook's room and said, "Okay. How 'bout
handing over those gloves?" Then the crook that had stolen them probably would've said,
his voice very innocent and all, "What gloves?" Then what I probably would've done, I'd
have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere. Hidden in his goddam galoshes
or something, for instance. I'd have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said,
"I suppose these are your goddam gloves?" Then the crook probably would've given me
this very phony, innocent look, and said, "I never saw those gloves before in my life. If
they're yours, take 'em. I don't want the goddam things." Then I probably would've just
stood there for about five minutes. I'd have the damn gloves right in my hand and all, but
I'd feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something--break his goddam jaw. Only, I
wouldn't have the guts to do it. I'd just stand there, trying to look tough. What I might do,
I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him up--instead of socking him in
the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty, he'd probably get up and
come over to me and say, "Listen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?" Then, instead
of saying, "You're goddam right I am, you dirty crooked bastard!" all I probably would've
said would be, "All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes." Right
away then, the guy would know for sure that I wasn't going to take a sock at him, and he
probably would've said, "Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?" Then
I probably would've said, "Nobody's calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves
were in your goddam galoshes." It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd
leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I'd probably go down to the can and
sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that's what I
thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It's no fun to he yellow. Maybe I'm not all
yellow. I don't know. I think maybe I'm just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn't
give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of my troubles is, I never care too
much when I lose something--it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid. Some
guys spend days looking for something they lost. I never seem to have anything that if I
lost it I'd care too much. Maybe that's why I'm partly yellow. It's no excuse, though. It
really isn't. What you should be is not yellow at all. If you're supposed to sock somebody
in the jaw, and you sort of feel like doing it, you should do it. I'm just no good at it,
though. I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
him in the jaw. I hate fist fights. I don't mind getting hit so much--although I'm not crazy
about it, naturally--but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy's face. I can't stand
looking at the other guy's face, is my trouble. It wouldn't be so bad if you could both be
blindfolded or something. It's a funny kind of yellowness, when you come to think of it,
but it's yellowness, all right. I'm not kidding myself. 
 The more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness, the more depressed I
got, and I decided, while I was walking and all, to stop off and have a drink somewhere.
I'd only had three drinks at Ernie's, and I didn't even finish the last one. One thing I have,
it's a terrific capacity. I can drink all night and not even show it, if I'm in the mood. Once,
at the Whooton School, this other boy, Raymond Goldfarb, and I bought a pint of Scotch
and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night, where nobody'd see us. He got stinking, but
I hardly didn't even show it. I just got very cool and nonchalant. I puked before I went to
bed, but I didn't really have to--I forced myself.
 Anyway, before I got to the hotel, I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar, but
two guys came out, drunk as hell, and wanted to know where the subway was. One of
them was this very Cuban-looking guy, and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my
face while I gave him directions. I ended up not even going in the damn bar. I just went
back to the hotel.
 The whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really did.
I wasn't sleepy or anything, but I was feeling sort of lousy. Depressed and all. I almost
wished I was dead.
 Then, all of a sudden, I got in this big mess.
 The first thing when I got in the elevator, the elevator guy said to me, "Innarested
in having a good time, fella? Or is it too late for you?"
 "How do you mean?" I said. I didn't know what he was driving at or anything.
 "Innarested in a little tail t'night?"
 "Me?" I said. Which was a very dumb answer, but it's quite embarrassing when
somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that.
 "How old are you, chief?" the elevator guy said.
 "Why?" I said. "Twenty-two."
 "Uh huh. Well, how 'bout it? Y'innarested? Five bucks a throw. Fifteen bucks the
whole night." He looked at his wrist watch. "Till noon. Five bucks a throw, fifteen bucks
till noon."
 "Okay," I said. It was against my principles and all, but I was feeling so depressed
I didn't even think. That's the whole trouble. When you're feeling very depressed, you
can't even think.
 "Okay what? A throw, or till noon? I gotta know."
 "Just a throw."
 "Okay, what room ya in?"
 I looked at the red thing with my number on it, on my key. "Twelve twenty-two,"
I said. I was already sort of sorry I'd let the thing start rolling, but it was too late now.
 "Okay. I'll send a girl up in about fifteen minutes." He opened the doors and I got
out.
 "Hey, is she good-looking?" I asked him. "I don't want any old bag."
 "No old bag. Don't worry about it, chief."
 "Who do I pay?"
 "Her," he said. "Let's go, chief." He shut the doors, practically right in my face.
 I went to my room and put some water on my hair, but you can't really comb a
crew cut or anything. Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and
the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernie's. All you do is hold your hand under your mouth
and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils. It didn't seem to stink much, but I 
brushed my teeth anyway. Then I put on another clean shirt. I knew I didn't have to get
all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort of gave me something to do. I was a
little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway.
If you want to know the truth, I'm a virgin. I really am. I've had quite a few opportunities
to lose my virginity and all, but I've never got around to it yet. Something always
happens. For instance, if you're at a girl's house, her parents always come home at the
wrong time--or you're afraid they will. Or if you're in the back seat of somebody's car,
there's always somebody's date in the front seat--some girl, I mean--that always wants to
know what's going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps
turning around to see what the hell's going on. Anyway, something always happens. I
came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular, I
remember. Something went wrong, though --I don't even remember what any more. The
thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it with a girl--a girl
that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean--she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with
me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never know whether they really want
you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell, or whether they're just telling you to
stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I
keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so
dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their
brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains. I don't
know. They tell me to stop, so I stop. I always wish I hadn't, after I take them home, but I
keep doing it anyway.
 Anyway, while I was putting on another clean shirt, I sort of figured this was my
big chance, in a way. I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in some practice
on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that stuff sometimes. I read
this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very sophisticated, suave, sexy guy
in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember. It was a lousy book, but
this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had this big château and all on the Riviera, in
Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club. He was a real
rake and all, but he knocked women out. He said, in this one part, that a woman's body is
like a violin and all, and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right. It was a very
corny book--I realize that--but I couldn't get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway. In a
way, that's why I sort of wanted to get some practice in, in case I ever get married.
Caulfield and his Magic Violin, boy. It's corny, I realize, but it isn't too corny. I wouldn't
mind being pretty good at that stuff. Half the time, if you really want to know the truth,
when I'm horsing around with a girl, I have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what I'm
looking for, for God's sake, if you know what I mean. Take this girl that I just missed
having sexual intercourse with, that I told you about. It took me about an hour to just get
her goddam brassiere off. By the time I did get it off, she was about ready to spit in my
eye.
 Anyway, I kept walking around the room, waiting for this prostitute to show up. I
kept hoping she'd be good-looking. I didn't care too much, though. I sort of just wanted to
get it over with. Finally, somebody knocked on the door, and when I went to open it, I
had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near broke my knee. I always
pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something. 
 When I opened the door, this prostitute was standing there. She had a polo coat
on, and no hat. She was sort of a blonde, but you could tell she dyed her hair. She wasn't
any old bag, though. "How do you do," I said. Suave as hell, boy.
 "You the guy Maurice said?" she asked me. She didn't seem too goddam friendly.
 "Is he the elevator boy?"
 "Yeah," she said.
 "Yes, I am. Come in, won't you?" I said. I was getting more and more nonchalant
as it went along. I really was.
 She came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed.
She had on a green dress underneath. Then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair
that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down. She
crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down. She was very nervous, for
a prostitute. She really was. I think it was because she was young as hell. She was around
my age. I sat down in the big chair, next to her, and offered her a cigarette. "I don't
smoke," she said. She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice. You could hardly hear her.
She never said thank you, either, when you offered her something. She just didn't know
any better.
 "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jim Steele," I said.
 "Ya got a watch on ya?" she said. She didn't care what the hell my name was,
naturally. "Hey, how old are you, anyways?"
 "Me? Twenty-two."
 "Like fun you are."
 It was a funny thing to say. It sounded like a real kid. You'd think a prostitute and
all would say "Like hell you are" or "Cut the crap" instead of "Like fun you are."
 "How old are you?" I asked her.
 "Old enough to know better," she said. She was really witty. "Ya got a watch on
ya?" she asked me again, and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head.
 I certainly felt peculiar when she did that. I mean she did it so sudden and all. I
know you're supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress
over their head, but I didn't. Sexy was about the last thing I was feeling. I felt much more
depressed than sexy.
 "Ya got a watch on ya, hey?"
 "No. No, I don't," I said. Boy, was I feeling peculiar. "What's your name?" I asked
her. All she had on was this pink slip. It was really quite embarrassing. It really was.
 "Sunny," she said. "Let's go, hey."
 "Don't you feel like talking for a while?" I asked her. It was a childish thing to
say, but I was feeling so damn peculiar. "Are you in a very big hurry?"
 She looked at me like I was a madman. "What the heck ya wanna talk about?" she
said.
 "I don't know. Nothing special. I just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a
while."
 She sat down in the chair next to the desk again. She didn't like it, though, you
could tell. She started jiggling her foot again--boy, she was a nervous girl.
 "Would you care for a cigarette now?" I said. I forgot she didn't smoke.
 "I don't smoke. Listen, if you're gonna talk, do it. I got things to do." 
 I couldn't think of anything to talk about, though. I thought of asking her how she
got to be a prostitute and all, but I was scared to ask her. She probably wouldn't've told
me anyway.
 "You don't come from New York, do you?" I said finally. That's all I could think
of.
 "Hollywood," she said. Then she got up and went over to where she'd put her
dress down, on the bed. "Ya got a hanger? I don't want to get my dress all wrinkly. It's
brand-clean."
 "Sure," I said right away. I was only too glad to get up and do something. I took
her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her. It was funny. It made me feel sort of
sad when I hung it up. I thought of her going in a store and buying it, and nobody in the
store knowing she was a prostitute and all. The salesman probably just thought she was a
regular girl when she bought it. It made me feel sad as hell--I don't know why exactly.
 I sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going. She was a lousy
conversationalist. "Do you work every night?" I asked her--it sounded sort of awful, after
I'd said it.
 "Yeah." She was walking all around the room. She picked up the menu off the
desk and read it.
 "What do you do during the day?"
 She sort of shrugged her shoulders. She was pretty skinny. "Sleep. Go to the
show." She put down the menu and looked at me. "Let's go, hey. I haven't got all--"
 "Look," I said. "I don't feel very much like myself tonight. I've had a rough night.
Honest to God. I'll pay you and all, but do you mind very much if we don't do it? Do you
mind very much?" The trouble was, I just didn't want to do it. I felt more depressed than
sexy, if you want to know the truth. She was depressing. Her green dress hanging in the
closet and all. And besides, I don't think I could ever do it with somebody that sits in a
stupid movie all day long. I really don't think I could.
 She came over to me, with this funny look on her face, like as if she didn't believe
me. "What'sa matter?" she said.
 "Nothing's the matter." Boy, was I getting nervous. "The thing is, I had an
operation very recently."
 "Yeah? Where?"
 "On my wuddayacallit--my clavichord."
 "Yeah? Where the hell's that?"
 "The clavichord?" I said. "Well, actually, it's in the spinal canal. I mean it's quite a
ways down in the spinal canal."
 "Yeah?" she said. "That's tough." Then she sat down on my goddam lap. "You're
cute."
 She made me so nervous, I just kept on lying my head off. "I'm still recuperating,"
I told her.
 "You look like a guy in the movies. You know. Whosis. You know who I mean.
What the heck's his name?"
 "I don't know," I said. She wouldn't get off my goddam lap.
 "Sure you know. He was in that pitcher with Mel-vine Douglas? The one that was
Mel-vine Douglas's kid brother? That falls off this boat? You know who I mean."
 "No, I don't. I go to the movies as seldom as I can
 he hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and
a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and
lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use
of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual
car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet
Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows
thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The
only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his
back in a flower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only
T 
CHAPTER ONE
 2 
way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight
down into the flower bed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his
aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the
boy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the
house.”
Uncle Vernon grunted.
“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime
Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on
our news —”
“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”
“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s
voice floated out of the window again. 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 3 
“Dudders out for tea?”
“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many little friends, he’s so popular . . .”
Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers
from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock
news reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night —
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”
“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened,
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . .
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet. . . .
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained
disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the 
CHAPTER ONE
 4 
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find
out more. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows,
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in
very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this
signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of
his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around
his throat.

 5 
“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now!
Before — anyone — sees!”
“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left
hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as
the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an
electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through
his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened
up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans
and tried to look innocent.
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their
strangling.
“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a
croaky voice that trembled with fury.
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made
the cracking noise.
“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”
“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid. 
CHAPTER ONE
 6 
“Why were you lurking under our window?”
“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our
window, boy?”
“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
“Listening to the news! Again?”
“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.
“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news
tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .”
“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot
don’t get on our news!”
“That’s all you know,” said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls —
doing if they’re not bringing you news?”
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!”
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.
“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.
“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.
“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.
“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 7 
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up
the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right
at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to
become invisible. . . .
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt
Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked
away.
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor’s house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer
rolled over him once again. . . .
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five 
CHAPTER ONE
 8 
o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily
Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry
merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days;
when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was
back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry
cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .”
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair
amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .”
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione
and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at
them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes
chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he,
Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it
been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?
Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments
too. 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 9 
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had
first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:
“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose clean
and everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do anything
rash. . . .”
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the
first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . .
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets.
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night,
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the 
CHAPTER ONE
 10 
trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was
getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell
with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world,
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only
sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were
laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing
bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang. 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 11 
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it,
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry
in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of
“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered
whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found
himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m
sitting here all alone. . . . Come and have ago. . . .
If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He
wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of
provoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond
. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell —
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.
. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use
magic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . .
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along
Magnolia Road. 
CHAPTER ONE
 12 
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws
from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his
ease, humming tunelessly.
“Hey, Big D!” 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 13 
Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled
into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights
ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the
only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on
the other. 
CHAPTER ONE
 14 
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley
said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing
out —”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely 
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 15 
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s
Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know
about Cedric?
“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’ ”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!”
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at
me!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,
struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you understand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, do you understand me?”
“Point it somewhere else!”
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been
doused in icy water. 
CHAPTER ONE
 16 
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening
was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that,
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a
weightless veil.
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing . . .
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before
he saw them. . . .
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are
you d-do — ?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some-
DUDLEY DEMENTED
 17 
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”
“Dudley, shut —”
WHAM!
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand
had flown out of his hand.
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as
he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in
the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley
fence, stumbling.
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT
IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps
stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him
that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand
— come on — Lumos!”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his
right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him,
hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes,
sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand. 
CHAPTER ONE
 18 
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him,
panic fogging his brain — concentrate —
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . .
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. . . . It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have
never died. . . .”
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for
breath —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?
DUDLEY!”
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de-

 19 
mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but —
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”

hat?” said Harry blankly.
“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble
this is going to cause! I will kill him!”
“But —”
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?”
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely
without cover when I warned him —”
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!”
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just
in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got

to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!”
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore?
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much
as Transfigured a teabag —”
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wizened hands, and tugged.
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!”
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go
of him he swayed dangerously.
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously
around the corner.
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy,
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?”
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the
same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He 
CHAPTER TWO
 22 
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the
ground.
“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg,
panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round
your house — why didn’t you say anything?”
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time,
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,” she said
tragically, wringing her hands once more, “when Dumbledore hears
about this — how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what’s happened, I can’t Apparate —”
“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, wondering
whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley’s weight.
“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they’ll know already, you mark my words —”
“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic — they’re
going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around
Wisteria Walk, surely?”
“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS
FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!”
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and
stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. “What ’appened to staying undercover?” 
A PECK OF OWLS
 23 
“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, you useless,
skiving sneak thief!”
“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?”
“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked
Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!”
“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to
Harry and back again. “Blimey, I . . .”
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go?
Didn’t I?”
“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . .
it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .”
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone’s gotta tell
Dumbledore!”
“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. “And — it —
had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him —
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!”
“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head,
cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!”
And with another loud crack, he vanished.
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now
come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?”
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.
“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet
Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word,
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and 
CHAPTER TWO
 24 
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs.
. . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the
cat’s among the pixies now . . .”
“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me
followed?”
“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did you expect
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right
. . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.”
“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly.
“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just
stay in the house. Good night.”
“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —”
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping,
string bag clanking.
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask
anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number
four’s garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the
front door.
“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — Diddy,
what’s the matter?”
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the
doormat. 
A PECK OF OWLS
 25 
“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!”
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated.
He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
“He’s ill, Vernon!”
“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you
something foreign for tea?”
“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on
the ground?”
“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, son?”
Aunt Petunia screamed.
“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak
to Mummy! What did they do to you?”
In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy
progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and
quietly toward the stairs.
“Who did it, son? Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry.”
“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell
Mummy!”
Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his
voice.
“Him.”
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the
explosion.
“BOY! COME HERE!”
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he 
CHAPTER TWO
 26 
was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.
“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon
wouldn’t believe him.
“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in a quavering
voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket.
“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his thing?”
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t
me, it was —”
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it
soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside
again and off across the garden.
“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY
HOUSE!”
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his
Adam’s apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening
in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason-
A PECK OF OWLS
 27 
able Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a
previous offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at
the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on August 12th.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,
improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all
over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced,
shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was retching again.
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy
your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run —
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the
kitchen. 
CHAPTER TWO
 28 
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When
Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!”
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry,
raising the wand.
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know
you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!”
“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —”
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed,
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He
spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting
outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed
window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry —
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to
sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC.
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.
A PECK OF OWLS
 29 
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean?
How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of
Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost
immediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to
surrender his wand without doing magic? He’d have to duel with the
Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape
Azkaban, let alone expulsion.
His mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here.
He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that
Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . .
“Right,” Harry said, “I’ve changed my mind, I’m staying.”
He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and
Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt
change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon.
The vein in Uncle Vernon’s purple temple was throbbing worse than
ever.
“Who are all these ruddy owls from?” he growled.
“The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,” said
Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case
the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and
quieter to answer Uncle Vernon’s questions than to have him start raging and bellowing. “The second one was from my friend Ron’s dad, he
works at the Ministry.”
“Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in
government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the
country’s going to the dogs. . . .”
When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then
spat, “And why have you been expelled?” 
CHAPTER TWO
 30 
“Because I did magic.”
“AHA!” roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of
the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley’s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. “So you admit it! What did you do to
Dudley?”
“Nothing,” said Harry, slightly less calmly. “That wasn’t me —”
“Was,” muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him
while they both bent low over Dudley.
“Go on, son,” said Uncle Vernon, “what did he do?”
“Tell us, darling,” whispered Aunt Petunia.
“Pointed his wand at me,” Dudley mumbled.
“Yeah, I did, but I didn’t use —” Harry began angrily, but . . .
“SHUT UP!” roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.
“Go on, son,” repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about
furiously.
“All dark,” Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. “Everything dark.
And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside m-my head . . .”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror.
If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed
by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban,
people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.
“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.
But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and
shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that
had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain
curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of
their life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have
been forced to hear?
“How come you fell over, son?” said Uncle Vernon in an unnatu-
A PECK OF OWLS
 31 
rally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a
very ill person.
“T-tripped,” said Dudley shakily. “And then —”
He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.
“Horrible,” croaked Dudley. “Cold. Really cold.”
“Okay,” said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt
Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley’s forehead to feel his temperature. “What happened then, Dudders?”
“Felt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if. . . as if . . .”
“As if you’d never be happy again,” Harry supplied tonelessly.
“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling.
“So,” said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable
volume as he straightened up. “So you put some crackpot spell on my
son so he’d hear voices and believe he was — was doomed to misery,
or something, did you?”
“How many times do I have to tell you?” said Harry, temper and
voice rising together. “It wasn’t me! It was a couple of dementors!”
“A couple of— what’s this codswallop?”
“De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly. “Two of
them.”
“And what the ruddy hell are dementors?”
“They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,” said Aunt Petunia.
Two seconds’ ringing silence followed these words and then Aunt
Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a
disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry’s
brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing — but Aunt Petunia?
“How d’you know that?” he asked her, astonished.
Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at
Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth. 
CHAPTER TWO
 32 
“I heard — that awful boy — telling her about them — years ago,”
she said jerkily.
“If you mean my mum and dad, why don’t you use their names?”
said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.
Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the
course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry’s mother had
been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the
magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into
pretending it didn’t exist.
Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once
more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk,
opened it for a third time and croaked, “So — so — they — er —
they — er — they actually exist, do they — er — dementy-whatsits?”
Aunt Petunia nodded.
Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if
hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did,
he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find
more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which
zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and
landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the
Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped
back out into the night.
“Enough — effing — owls . . .” muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes
ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy
your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your 
A PECK OF OWLS
 33 
disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official
decision will be taken.
Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed
that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that
time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from
school pending further inquiries.
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The
miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he
was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of
August.
“Well?” said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings.
“What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have
the death penalty?” he added as a hopeful afterthought.
“I’ve got to go to a hearing,” said Harry.
“And they’ll sentence you there?”
“I suppose so.”
“I won’t give up hope, then,” said Uncle Vernon nastily.
“Well, if that’s all,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate
to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or
Sirius.
“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon.
“SIT BACK DOWN!” 
CHAPTER TWO
 34 
“What now?” said Harry impatiently.
“DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon. “I want to know exactly what
happened to my son!”
“FINE!” yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot
out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.
“Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent
and Wisteria Walk,” said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his
temper. “Dudley thought he’d be smart with me, I pulled out my
wand but didn’t use it. Then two dementors turned up —”
“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon furiously.
“What do they DO?”
“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” said Harry,
“and if they get the chance, they kiss you —”
“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. “Kiss you?”
“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.”
Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.
“His soul? They didn’t take — he’s still got his —”
She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.
“Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,” said
Harry, exasperated.
“Fought ’em off, did you, son?” said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the
appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a
plane he understood. “Gave ’em the old one-two, did you?”
“You can’t give a dementor the old one-two,” said Harry through
clenched teeth.
“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon. “Why isn’t he
all empty, then?”
“Because I used the Patronus —”
WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of
dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace. 
A PECK OF OWLS
 35 
“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps
of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn’t been driven to in a
long time. “I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT
TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!”
But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl’s
leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore,
explaining everything — the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything
out — that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius’s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s ongoing rant about owls
and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius’s message.
Arthur’s just told us what’s happened.
Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do.
Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that
had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over,
looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there.
And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t anybody going to say
“well done” for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr.
Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they
were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much
damage had been done.
“— a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house
and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t —”
“I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s letter in his fist.
“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” barked Uncle
Vernon. “If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you’ve
been expelled? You did you-know-what, you’ve admitted it!”
Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to 
CHAPTER TWO
 36 
ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen,
away from the Dursleys.
“I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,” he said,
forcing himself to remain calm. “It’s the only thing that works against
them.”
“But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?” said Uncle
Vernon in tones of outrage.
“Couldn’t tell you,” said Harry wearily. “No idea.”
His head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His
anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were
all staring at him.
“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “It’s got something to do
with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else
would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the
only —” Evidently he couldn’t bring himself to say the word “wizard.”
“The only you-know-what for miles.”
“I don’t know why they were here. . . .”
But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain
ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little
Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the
alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of
Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and
joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?
“These demembers guard some weirdos’ prison?” said Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry’s train of thought.
“Yes,” said Harry.
If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the
kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think. . . .
“Oho! They were coming to arrest you!” said Uncle Vernon, with
the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion.
“That’s it, isn’t it, boy? You’re on the run from the law!” 
A PECK OF OWLS
 37 
“Of course I’m not,” said Harry, shaking his head as though to
scare off a fly, his mind racing now.
“Then why — ?”
“He must have sent them,” said Harry quietly, more to himself
than to Uncle Vernon.
“What’s that? Who must have sent them?”
“Lord Voldemort,” said Harry.
He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who
flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,”
“magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all
time without the slightest tremor.
“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look
of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name
. . . that was the one who . . .”
“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said.
“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry’s parents might be a painful topic to
anybody. “That giant bloke said so. He’s gone.”
“He’s back,” said Harry heavily.
It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically
clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen
television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon.
The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have
caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly
non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry’s two
lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical
world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts.
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully.
“Back?” whispered Aunt Petunia. 
CHAPTER TWO
 38 
She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before.
And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister. He could not have
said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew
was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling
of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had
never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so
unlike her sister’s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were
wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry’s life — that there was no magic and no world other
than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon — seemed to have
fallen away.
“Yes,” Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. “He came
back a month ago. I saw him.”
Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad shoulders and
clutched them.
“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and
back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. “Hang on.
This Lord Voldything’s back, you say.”
“Yes.”
“The one who murdered your parents.”
“Yes.”
“And now he’s sending dismembers after you?”
“Looks like it,” said Harry.
“I see,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to
Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his
great purple face stretching before Harry’s eyes. “Well, that settles it,”
he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, “you can get out
of this house, boy!”
“What?” said Harry.
“You heard me — OUT!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt 
A PECK OF OWLS
 39 
Petunia and Dudley jumped. “OUT! OUT! I should’ve done it years
ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half
the lounge destroyed, Dudley’s tail, Marge bobbing around on the
ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia — OUT! OUT! You’ve had it!
You’re history! You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re
not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down
on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it!
OUT!”
Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry,
Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don’t leave the
house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE.
“You heard me!” said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that
his massive purple face came closer to Harry’s, so that Harry actually
felt flecks of spit hit his face. “Get going! You were all keen to leave
half an hour ago! I’m right behind you! Get out and never darken our
doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place I don’t know.
Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too
damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you,
thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the
beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!”
The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the
floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry
raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but
it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let
out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the
red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney
again.
Harry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat
him to it.
“You can open it if you like,” said Harry, “but I’ll hear what it says
anyway. That’s a Howler.” 
CHAPTER TWO
 40 
“Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “Don’t touch it, it
could be dangerous!”
“It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. “It’s
addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen,
Number Four, Privet Drive —”
She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to
smoke.
“Open it!” Harry urged her. “Get it over with! It’ll happen
anyway —”
“No —”
Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the
kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late — the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.
An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.
“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.”
Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the
chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smoldered into ash in the silence.
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. “What — I don’t —
Petunia?”
Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his
mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry
was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to
burst.
“Petunia, dear?” said Uncle Vernon timidly. “P-Petunia?”
She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.
“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly.
“W-what?” 
A PECK OF OWLS
 41 
“He stays,” she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her
feet again.
“He . . . but Petunia . . .”
“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,” she said. She was regaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still
very pale. “They’ll ask awkward questions, they’ll want to know where
he’s gone. We’ll have to keep him.”
Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.
“But Petunia, dear —”
Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.
“You’re to stay in your room,” she said. “You’re not to leave the
house. Now get to bed.”
Harry didn’t move.
“Who was that Howler from?”
“Don’t ask questions,” Aunt Petunia snapped.
“Are you in touch with wizards?”
“I told you to get to bed!”
“What did it mean? Remember the last what?”
“Go to bed!”
“How come — ?”
“YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!”

THE ADVANCED GUARD
’ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from
Hogwarts. I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get
out of here.
Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment
the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed
the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His
owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk.
Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head
pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and
itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home,
and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit
him were throbbing painfully.
Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration,
grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at
the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him
in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.
I 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 43 
And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had
echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?
Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was
everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don’t do any more
magic, stay in the house. . . .
He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his
anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with
in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.
Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with
a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.
“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her
cage. “You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!”
Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over
the dead frog clamped in her beak.
“Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take
these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here
without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written
decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?”
Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.
“Get going, then,” said Harry.
She took off immediately. The moment she’d gone, Harry threw
himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark
ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty
that he’d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at
number four, Privet Drive. But he’d make it up to her when she came
back with Sirius’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s answers.
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore a dementor attack. He’d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat
letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the
Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling
all further thought. 
CHAPTER THREE
 44 
  
But Hedwig didn’t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his
bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day
Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle
Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her
approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might
as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got.
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn’t
see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would
achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he’d perform
more illegal magic.
So it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with
restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during
which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them
for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete
that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into
space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.
What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his
wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go?
He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now
that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.
. . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house,
as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee
from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone,
given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he
went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International
Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his
bed and began pacing again.
On the fourth night after Hedwig’s departure Harry was lying in
one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 45 
quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked
slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an
expression of enormous smugness.
“We’re going out,” he said.
“Sorry?”
“We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out.”
“Fine,” said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.
“You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.”
“Okay.”
“You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our
possessions.”
“Right.”
“You are not to steal food from the fridge.”
“Okay.”
“I am going to lock your door.”
“You do that.”
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind
him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon’s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the
slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable
sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made
no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could
not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light.
The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the
night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting
for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.
The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry
lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in
misery.
And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below. 
CHAPTER THREE
 46 
He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be
back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.
Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split
second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices
down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly
not troubling to do so.
He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing
his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he
jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark
upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came.
He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of
his room to the head of the stairs.
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing
in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing
through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could
see, looking up at him.
“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a
low, growling voice.
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice,
but he did not lower his wand.
“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.
“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’ ” growled the voice, “never
got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you
properly.”
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor
did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye
Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an
impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 47 
being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to
do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.
“It’s all right, Harry. We’ve come to take you away.”
Harry’s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t
heard it for more than a year.
“P-Professor Lupin?” he said disbelievingly. “Is that you?”
“Why are we all standing in the dark?” said a third voice, this one
completely unfamiliar, a woman’s. “Lumos.”
A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry
blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs,
gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young,
Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when
Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched
and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry,
who tried to smile back through his shock.
“Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,” said the witch who
was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had
a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that
was a violent shade of violet. “Wotcher, Harry!”
“Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard
standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single
gold hoop in his ear. “He looks exactly like James.”
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the
back. “Lily’s eyes.”
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large
chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry
through his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and
beady, the other large, round, and electric blue — the magical eye that
could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice 
CHAPTER THREE
 48 
lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We
ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless
anyone brought any Veritaserum?”
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.
“A stag,” said Harry nervously.
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring
at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!”
“Who d’you know who’s lost a buttock?” the violet-haired woman
asked Mad-Eye interestedly.
“Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back
pocket!” growled Mad-Eye. “Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers
about it anymore. . . .” He stumped off toward the kitchen. “And I saw
that,” he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.
Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry’s.
“How are you?” he asked, looking at Harry closely.
“F-fine . . .”
Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing,
not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and
suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in
the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He
glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly
at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his
hair for four days.
“I’m — you’re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .” he mumbled.
“Lucky, ha!” said the violet-haired woman. “It was me that lured
them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they’d
been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn
Competition. They’re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . .
Or they think they are.” 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 49 
Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon’s face when he realized
there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.
“We are leaving, aren’t we?” he asked. “Soon?”
“Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.”
“Where are we going? The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully.
“Not the Burrow, no,” said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the
kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. “Too risky. We’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable.
It’s taken a while. . . .”
Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging
from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in
the Dursleys’ many labor-saving appliances.
“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward
Moody.
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year.
“And this is Nymphadora —”
“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a
shudder. “It’s Tonks.”
“— Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname
only,” finished Lupin.
“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nymphadora,’ ” muttered Tonks.
“And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” — he indicated the tall black
wizard, who bowed — “Elphias Doge” — the wheezy-voiced wizard
nodded — “Dedalus Diggle —”
“We’ve met before,” squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his
top hat.
“— Emmeline Vance” — a stately looking witch in an emeraldgreen shawl inclined her head — “Sturgis Podmore” — a square-jawed
wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winked — “and Hestia Jones.” A
pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster. 
CHAPTER THREE
 50 
Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it
was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.
“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,”
said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his
mouth twitched slightly.
“Yeah, well, the more the better,” said Moody darkly. “We’re your
guard, Potter.”
“We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said
Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. “We’ve got about fifteen
minutes.”
“Very clean, aren’t they, these Muggles?” said the witch called
Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. “My
dad’s Muggle-born and he’s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just
like with wizards?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry. “Look” — he turned back to Lupin —
“what’s going on, I haven’t heard anything from anyone, what’s Vol — ?”
Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises;
Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, “Shut up!”
“What?” said Harry.
“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody,
turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing
up at the ceiling. “Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to
the magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it —”
And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being
pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.
“Mad-Eye, you do know that’s disgusting, don’t you?” said Tonks
conversationally.
“Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry?” asked Moody.
Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 51 
with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards.
Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.
“Cheers,” said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He
dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and
down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. “I want
three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.”
“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.
“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way. You’re too young to Apparate,
they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and it’s more than our life’s
worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.”
“Remus says you’re a good flier,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his
deep voice.
“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch. “Anyway, you’d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go
when the signal comes.”
“I’ll come and help you,” said Tonks brightly.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking
around with much curiosity and interest.
“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit too clean, d’you know what I
mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered
Harry’s bedroom and he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house.
Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn
over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and
thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to
smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle
clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his
trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door. 
CHAPTER THREE
 52 
“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. “D’you think it makes me look
a bit peaky?”
“Er —” said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch
Teams of Britain and Ireland.
“Yeah, it does,” said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a
strained expression as though she were struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
“How did you do that?” said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her
eyes again.
“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at her reflection
and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions.
“It means I can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting
Harry’s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one.
I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training
without any study at all, it was great.”
“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard
catcher was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.
“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit
higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed
on Stealth and Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that
plate when we arrived downstairs?”
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not
like people staring at his scar.
“Well, you’ll have to learn the hard way, I’m afraid,” said Tonks.
“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . . 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 53 
But we’ve got to get going, Harry, we’re supposed to be packing,” she
added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.
“Oh — yeah,” said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.
“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!” cried Tonks,
waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew
pell-mell into the trunk.
“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. “My mum’s got this knack of getting
stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold themselves — but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’s a kind of
flick —”
She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’s socks gave a feeble
sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within.
“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all
in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify —” She
pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished. “Well, that’s a bit better — I’ve never quite got the hang of
these sort of householdy spells. Right — got everything? Cauldron?
Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right
hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go.
Locomotor Trunk.”
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the
door ahead of them, Hedwig’s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her
down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was
spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley

Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and
Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while
rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the
Dursleys.
“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered.
“We’ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into
the garden so we’re ready. Harry, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and
uncle not to worry —”
“They won’t,” said Harry.
“That you’re safe —”
“That’ll just depress them.”
“— and you’ll see them next summer.”
“Do I have to?”
Lupin smiled but made no answer.
“Come here, boy,” said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward
him with his wand. “I need to Disillusion you.”
“You need to what?” said Harry nervously.
“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody, raising his wand. “Lupin
says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won’t stay on while we’re
flying; this’ll disguise you better. Here you go —”
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold
trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand
had struck.
“Nice one, Mad-Eye,” said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry’s
midriff.
Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body,
for it didn’t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had
simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.
They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon’s beautifully kept lawn.

“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. “Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,” he
barked at Harry, “we’re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks’ll
be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be covering
you from below. I’m going to be behind you. The rest’ll be circling us.
We don’t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed —”
“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored
him.
“— the others keep flying, don’t stop, don’t break ranks. If they
take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing
by to take over; keep flying east and they’ll join you.”
“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not taking this
seriously,” said Tonks, as she strapped Harry’s trunk and Hedwig’s
cage into a harness hanging from her broom.
“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody. “Our job’s to
deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt —”
“No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep,
calming voice.
“Mount your brooms, that’s the first signal!” said Lupin sharply,
pointing into the sky.
Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among
the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung
his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it
vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in
the air once more.
“Second signal, let’s go!” said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green
this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed
through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away,
shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as
though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though 
CHAPTER THREE
 56 
his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer,
he was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems
seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.
“Hard left, hard left, there’s a Muggle looking up!” shouted Moody
from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching
his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. “We need more height.
. . . Give it another quarter of a mile!”
Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see
nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights
and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon’s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty
house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition
. . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was
drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their
ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month,
or this happy. . . .
“Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye. “Town ahead!”
They soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below.
“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead
we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody.
“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily. “We’ll
get soaked, Mad-Eye!”
Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing
numb on the Firebolt’s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a
coat; he was starting to shiver.
They altered their course every now and then according to MadEye’s instructions. Harry’s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy
wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch 
THE ADVANCED GUARD
 57 
match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a
storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant
birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they
had been flying; it felt like an hour at least.
“Turning southwest!” yelled Moody. “We want to avoid the
motorway!”
Harry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment
of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even
more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames.
. . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring
gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on
his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she
too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . .
“We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we’re not being followed!” Moody shouted.
“ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?” Tonks screamed from the front.
“We’re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we’re not
going to get there until next week! We’re nearly there now!”
“Time to start the descent!” came Lupin’s voice. “Follow Tonks,
Harry!”
Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest
collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing
mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual
headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. He
wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.
“Here we go!” called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch
of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already
unbuckling Harry’s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy 
CHAPTER THREE
 58 
fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them
had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish
lay outside several sets of front steps.
“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.”
Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with
cold.
“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette
lighter into the air and clicking it.
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every
lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square
came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.
“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the
Put-Outer. “That’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come on, quick.”
He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass,
across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed,
carrying Harry’s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with
their wands out, flanking them.
The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came
from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.
“Here,” Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward
Harry’s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as
to illuminate the writing. “Read quickly and memorize.”
Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting
was vaguely familiar. It said:
The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at
number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. 
C H A P T E R F O U R

hat’s the Order of the — ?” Harry began.
“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody. “Wait till we’re inside!”
He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry’s hand and set fire
to it with his wand tip. As the message curled into flames and floated
to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were
standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.
“But where’s — ?”
“Think about what you’ve just memorized,” said Lupin quietly.
Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of
nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by
dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had
inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it.
The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn’t even felt anything.
“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.
W 
CHAPTER FOUR
 60 
Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door
knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or
letterbox.
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard
many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a
chain. The door creaked open.
“Get in quick, Harry,” Lupin whispered. “But don’t go far inside
and don’t touch anything.”
Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of
the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the
place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying
his trunk and Hedwig’s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and
releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed
momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and
closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.
“Here —”
He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as
though something hot was trickling down his back this time and
knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.
“Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,”
Moody whispered.
The others’ hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying
person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas
lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a
long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry 
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
 61 
heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier
and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.
There were hurried footsteps and Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley,
emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in
welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she
was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen
her.
“Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you!” she whispered, pulling him into
a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm’s length and examining
him critically. “You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll
have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid. . . .”
She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, “He’s just arrived, the meeting’s started. . . .”
The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past Harry toward the door through which
Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs.
Weasley held him back.
“No, Harry, the meeting’s only for members of the Order. Ron and
Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s
over and then we’ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the
hall,” she added in an urgent whisper.
“Why?”
“I don’t want to wake anything up.”
“What d’you — ?”
“I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.”
Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of
long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must
be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked
as though it had been made from a severed troll’s leg, they started up
the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on 
CHAPTER FOUR
 62 
plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on
earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to
the Darkest of wizards?
“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”
“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to
dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had
reached the second landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call
you when it’s over.”
And she hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob,
which was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded
room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even
louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair — Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a
hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon,
zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.
“HARRY! Ron, he’s here, Harry’s here! We didn’t hear you arrive!
Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I
bet you have, I know our letters were useless — but we couldn’t tell
you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn’t, oh, we’ve got
so much to tell you, and you’ve got to tell us — the dementors! When
we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve
looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision
in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of
magic in life-threatening situations —”
“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door
behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during
their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than
ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same. 
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
 63 
Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say
another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white
soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s
shoulder.
“Hedwig!”
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately
as Harry stroked her feathers.
“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death
when she brought your last letters, look at this —”
He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported
a half-healed but clearly deep cut.
“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers,
you know. . . .”
“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was
going spare, she kept saying you’d do something stupid if you were
stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us —”
“— swear not to tell me,” said Harry. “Yeah, Hermione’s already
said.”
The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two
best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his
stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid
month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.
There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others.
“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breathlessly. “Dumbledore, I mean.”
“Right,” said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks
of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.
“I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles —” Ron
began.
“Yeah?” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Have either of you been
attacked by dementors this summer?” 
CHAPTER FOUR
 64 
“Well, no — but that’s why he’s had people from the Order of the
Phoenix tailing you all the time —”
Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step
going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed except him.
“Didn’t work that well, though, did it?” said Harry, doing his
utmost to keep his voice even. “Had to look after myself after all,
didn’t I?”
“He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice.
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left
before his shift had ended. He was scary.”
“Well, I’m glad he left,” Harry said coldly. “If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t
have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at
Privet Drive all summer.”
“Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic
hearing?” said Hermione quietly.
“No,” Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking
around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this
room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank
stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the
bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he
heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.
“So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?”
Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. “Did you —
er — bother to ask him at all?”
He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told
him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing
to improve his temper.
“We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,”
said Ron. “We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen
him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just 
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
 65 
made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said
the owls might be intercepted —”
“He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said
shortly. “You’re not telling me he doesn’t know ways to send messages
without owls.”
Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, “I thought that too. But
he didn’t want you to know anything.”
“Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted,” said Harry, watching their expressions.
“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.
“Or that I can’t take care of myself —”
“Of course he doesn’t think that!” said Hermione anxiously.
“So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to
join in everything that’s going on here?” said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every
word. “How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s going on — ?”
“We’re not!” Ron interrupted. “Mum won’t let us near the meetings, she says we’re too young —”
But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL!
YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL
BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN
YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE
KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE?
WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR
SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?”
Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past
month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the
hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being 
CHAPTER FOUR
 66 
followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of
finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and
soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in
alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES
AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW
HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!”
Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned
and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge
of tears.
“BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY
SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN
HAPPENING?”
“Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did —” Hermione began.
“CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR
YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE
MADE YOU SWEAR —”
“Well, he did —”
“FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE,
NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT
WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —”
“We wanted to —”
“I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH,
HAVEN’T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER —”
“No, honest —”
“Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now
sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious
if it was me!”
Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from
them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the
top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the
mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet. 
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
 67 
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.
“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once.
“Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the
Phoenix — ?”
“It’s a secret society,” said Hermione quickly. “Dumbledore’s in
charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-KnowWho last time.”
“Who’s in it?” said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his
pockets.
“Quite a few people —”
“— we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think
there are more. . . .”
Harry glared at them.
“Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other.
“Er,” said Ron. “Well what?”
“Voldemort!” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione
winced. “What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are
we doing to stop him?”
“We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said
Hermione nervously. “So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a
general idea —” she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry’s face.
“Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,” said Ron.
“They’re really useful.”
“Extendable — ?”
“Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because
Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them
all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of
them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the
Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you
know —”
“— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the
Order —” said Hermione. 
CHAPTER FOUR
 68 
“— and some of them are standing guard over something,” said
Ron. “They’re always talking about guard duty.”
“Couldn’t have been me, could it?” said Harry sarcastically.
“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.
Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. “So what have you two been doing,
if you’re not allowed in meetings?” he demanded. “You said you’d
been busy.”
“We have,” said Hermione quickly. “We’ve been decontaminating
this house, it’s been empty for ages and stuff’s been breeding in here.
We’ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I
think we’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH!”
With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers,
had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig
on top of the wardrobe.
“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as
vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.
“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him. “We thought we
heard your dulcet tones.”
“You don’t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all
out,” said Fred, also beaming. “There might be a couple of people fifty
miles away who didn’t hear you.”
“You two passed your Apparation tests, then?” asked Harry
grumpily.
“With distinction,” said Fred, who was holding what looked like a
piece of very long, flesh-colored string.
“It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down
the stairs,” said Ron.
“Time is Galleons, little brother,” said Fred. “Anyway, Harry, you’re
interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,” he added in response to 
NUMBER TWELVE,
GRIMMAULD PLACE
 69 
Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw
was trailing out onto the landing. “We’re trying to hear what’s going
on downstairs.”
“You want to be careful,” said Ron, staring at the ear. “If Mum sees
one of them again . . .”
“It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said
Fred.
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.
“Oh hello, Harry!” said Ron’s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. “I
thought I heard your voice.”
Turning to Fred and George she said, “It’s no go with the Extendable Ears, she’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen
door.”
“How d’you know?” said George, looking crestfallen.
“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny. “You just chuck stuff
at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed.
I’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they
just soar away from it, so there’s no way the Extendable Ears will be
able to get under the gap.”
Fred heaved a deep sigh. “Shame. I really fancied finding out what
old Snape’s been up to.”
“Snape?” said Harry quickly. “Is he here?”
“Yeah,” said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on
one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. “Giving a report. Top
secret.”
“Git,” said Fred idly.
“He’s on our side now,” said Hermione reprovingly.
Ron snorted. “Doesn’t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us
when he sees us. . . .”
“Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled the
matter. 
CHAPTER FOUR
 70 
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for
information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank
onto the bed opposite the others.
“Is Bill here?” he asked. “I thought he was working in Egypt.”
“He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the
Order,” said Fred. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked,
“there are compensations. . . .”
“What d’you mean?”
“Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at
Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —”
“— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered
Fred.
“Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania,
Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so
Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.”
“Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the
third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly
significant looks.
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and
Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice.
“Why not?”
“Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said.
“It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly.
“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.
“What’s happened?” Harry said.
“Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row
with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. . . .”
“It was the first week back after term ended,” said Ron. “We were

about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d
been promoted.”
“You’re kidding?” said Harry.
Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious,
Harry’s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his
first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large
oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by
Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that — they all
thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).
“Yeah, we were all surprised,” said George, “because Percy got into
a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything.
They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and
informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge,
he wasn’t going to complain. . . .”
“So how come they promoted him?”
“That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very
keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped
yelling. “He came home really pleased with himself — even more
pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he’d been
offered a position in Fudge’s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister.
He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.”
“Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.
“Why not?” said Harry.
“Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry
checking that nobody’s having any contact with Dumbledore,” said
George.
“Dumbledore’s name’s mud with the Ministry these days, see,” said
Fred. “They all think he’s just making trouble saying You-KnowWho’s back.”
“Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who’s in league with
Dumbledore can clear out their desks,” said George. 
CHAPTER FOUR

“Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he’s friendly with Dumbledore, and he’s always thought Dad’s a bit of a weirdo because of his
Muggle obsession —”
“But what’s this got to do with Percy?” asked Harry, confused.
“I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his
office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and
Dumbledore.”
Harry let out a low whistle.
“Bet Percy loved that.”
Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way.
“He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy
reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no
ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a
lot of money, I mean —”
“What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.
“I know,” said Ron in a low voice. “And it got worse. He said Dad
was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was
heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and
that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the
Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the
Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong
to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and
left. He’s living here in London now.”
Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of
Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things
to Mr. Weasley.
“Mum’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “You know — crying and
stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed
the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work —
ignores him, I s’pose.”

“But Percy must know Voldemort’s back,” said Harry slowly. “He’s
not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof —”
“Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. “Percy said the only evidence was your word
and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.”
“Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,” said Hermione tartly, and
the others all nodded.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, looking around at
them all. They were all regarding him warily.
“Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?” Hermione asked nervously.
“Yeah, I have!” said Harry.
“Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly?” Hermione asked
still more anxiously.
“Not cover to cover,” said Harry defensively. “If they were going
to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news,
wouldn’t it!”
The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried
on, “Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but
they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.”
“But I’d have seen —”
“Not if you’ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn’t,” said
Hermione, shaking her head. “I’m not talking about big articles. They
just slip you in, like you’re a standing joke.”
“What d’you — ?”
“It’s quite nasty, actually,” said Hermione in a voice of forced calm.
“They’re just building on Rita’s stuff.”
“But she’s not writing for them anymore, is she?”
“Oh no, she’s kept her promise — not that she’s got any choice,”
Hermione added with satisfaction. “But she laid the foundation for
what they’re trying to do now.” 
CHAPTER FOUR
 74 
“Which is what?” said Harry impatiently.
“Okay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the
place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter’s stories about him in a hurry.
“Well, they’re writing about you as though you’re this deluded,
attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something,” said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant
for Harry to hear these facts quickly. “They keep slipping in snide
comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny
accident or anything it’s ‘let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead
or we’ll be asked to worship him next —’ ”
“I don’t want anyone to worship —” Harry began hotly.
“I know you don’t,” said Hermione quickly, looking frightened.
“I know, Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn
you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet
anything. They want wizards on the street to think you’re just some
stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because
he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.”
“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — Voldemort killed my parents!”
Harry spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but
couldn’t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think
I’d rather it’d never —”
“We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.
“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors attacking you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that
quiet. That should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven’t even reported that you broke the International
Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would, it would tie in so well
with this image of you as some stupid show-off — we think they’re

biding their time until you’re expelled, then they’re really going to go
to town — I mean, if you’re expelled, obviously,” she went on hastily,
“you really shouldn’t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there’s no
case against you.”
They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think
about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved
the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs.
“Uh-oh.”
Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud
crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.
“The meeting’s over, you can come down and have dinner now,
everyone’s dying to see you, Harry. And who’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?”
“Crookshanks,” said Ginny unblushingly. “He loves playing with
them.”
“Oh,” said Mrs. Weasley, “I thought it might have been Kreacher,
he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don’t forget to keep your
voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you
been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please. . . .”
Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the
room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of
them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he
would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight
of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.
“Look . . .” he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione
said quietly, “We knew you’d be angry, Harry, we really don’t blame
you, but you’ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore —”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry grudgingly
his book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its
pages a reader may discover much of their character and a
little of their history. Further information will also be found
in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has
already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. That
story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,
composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become
famous in the world at large, and called by him There and
Back Again, since they told of his journey into the East and
his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
in the great events of that Age that are here related.
Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess
the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and
the first adventure is briefly recalled.
Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and wellfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not
and did not understand or like machines more complicated
than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though
they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they
were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and
now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to
find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though
they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they
are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They
2 prologue
possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and
silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come
blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men
it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied
magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to
a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close
friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger
and clumsier races.
For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout
and stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much
shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and
four feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet;
but they have dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they
were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took
(Bullroarer), son of Isumbras the Third, was four foot five
and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit
records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious
matter is dealt with in this book.
As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are
concerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they
were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being
notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore
shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad
in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which
was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised
among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful
fingers and could make many other useful and comely things.
Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to
laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and
eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests
at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get
them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in
presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.
It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits
are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than
Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their
prologue 3
own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as
Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer
be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the
Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves
still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their
traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived
quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk
became even aware of them. And the world being after all
full of strange creatures beyond count, these little people
seemed of very little importance. But in the days of Bilbo,
and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of
their own, both important and renowned, and troubled the
counsels of the Wise and the Great.
Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long
past, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the
regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same
as those in which they still linger: the North-West of the Old
World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the Hobbits
in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning
(other than genealogical lore) was far from general among
them, but there remained still a few in the older families who
studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old
times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their
own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and
their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than
their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these
legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and
customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant
past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a
time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between
the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains.
Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of
the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their own
accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of
4 prologue
a shadow that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened
and its new name was Mirkwood.
Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had
already become divided into three somewhat different breeds:
Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner
of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and
bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; and they
preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader,
heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger; and they
preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer
of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer
than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.
The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient
times, and long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They
moved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as
Weathertop while the others were still in Wilderland. They
were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit,
and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to
settle in one place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit
of living in tunnels and holes.
The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River
Anduin, and were less shy of Men. They came west after the
Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad
and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again.
The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly
branch. They were more friendly with Elves than the other
Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than
in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling.
They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came
down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with
the other kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat
bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as
leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even
in Bilbo’s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be
noted among the greater families, such as the Tooks and the
Masters of Buckland.
prologue 5
In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains
and the Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and
Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Du´nedain, the
kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but
they were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room
and to spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began
to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo’s
time; but one of the first to become important still endured,
though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood
that lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.
It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits
learned their letters and began to write after the manner of
the Du´nedain, who had in their turn long before learned the
art from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after the
Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was
current through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to
Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to
Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their
own names of months and days, and a great store of personal
names out of the past.
About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes
history with a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the
Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree;
and having obtained permission from the high king at
Fornost,* they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a
great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of
Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of
the North Kingdom, and they took all the land beyond to
dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was
* As the records of Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, the twentieth
of the Northern line, which came to an end with Arvedui three hundred
years later.
6 prologue
demanded of them was that they should keep the Great
Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the
king’s messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.
Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing
of the Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became
Year One of the Shire, and all later dates were reckoned from
it.* At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new
land, and they remained there, and soon passed once more
out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still
a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact,
ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with
events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornost with
the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid
of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men
record it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and
then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they chose
from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the
king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were
little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied
after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long
Winter and the famine that followed it. Many thousands then
perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158–60) were at the time
of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become
accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and
though it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had
before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many
farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.
Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the
Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the northern moors to
the marshes in the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire,
as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a district
of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant corner of
the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and
* Thus, the years of the Third Age in the reckoning of the Elves and
the Du´nedain may be found by adding 1600 to the dates of Shirereckoning.
prologue 7
they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things
moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were
the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk.
They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of
the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible
the long peace of the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but
they had ceased to remember it.
At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they
had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had,
of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves
in a hard world; but in Bilbo’s time that was very ancient
history. The last battle, before this story opens, and indeed
the only one that had ever been fought within the borders
of the Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of
Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an
invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and
the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in
bitter white winters were now only a grandfather’s tale. So,
though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire,
these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths or
on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving.
The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits
had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away,
they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become
rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that
passed from hand to hand were of that sort.
Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or
to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good
things not least because they could, when put to it, do without
them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or
weather in a way that astonished those who did not know
them well and looked no further than their bellies and their
well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing
nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need
could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they
were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and
8 prologue
arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get
quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.
All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or
so they believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at
home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to
adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo’s
days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the poorest Hobbits
that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living
in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed,
with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still
constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings
of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels
(or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to be
found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits,
as they multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even
in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Hobbiton
or Tuckborough, or in the chief township of the Shire, Michel
Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses
of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by
millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that
sort; for even when they had holes to live in, Hobbits had
long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.
The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to
have begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by
the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore
dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to
be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown
by the down that many grew on their chins. No Harfoot or
Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the
Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire
up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar names
and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire.
It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts
beside, was derived from the Du´nedain. But the Hobbits may
have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in
prologue 9
their youth. For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet
forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that time at the
Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within
reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were
still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western
marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest
was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The
Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea
from the top of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been
known to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or
sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to
report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats
with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim.
And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and
less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful
of those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a
word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they
turned their faces away from the hills in the west.
The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men,
but the Hobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not
go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and
comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than
built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or
roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That
stage, however, belonged to the early days of the Shire, and
hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by
devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves.
A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was
the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.
The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large,
and inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins
were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many
other ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or the
Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives
lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and
many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case,
10 prologue
clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care.
They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable
branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember
who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be
impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that included
even the more important members of the more important
families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical
trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small
book in themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them
exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were
accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that they
already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.
2
Concerning Pipe-weed
There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that
must be mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or
inhaled, through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the
burning leaves of a herb, which they called pipe-weed or leaf,
a variety probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery
surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or ‘art’ as the
Hobbits preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about
it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck
(later Master of Buckland), and since he and the tobacco of
the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his
remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may
be quoted.
‘This,’ he says, ‘is the one art that we can certainly claim
to be our own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke
is not known, all the legends and family histories take it for
granted; for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some
fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold
Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew
the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the
Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best
prologue 11
home-grown still comes from that district, especially the
varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and
Southern Star.
‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to
his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs,
but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went
often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from
the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned
of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on
the south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have
been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim,
of course, to have done everything before the people of the
Shire, whom they refer to as ‘‘colonists’’; but in this case their
claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from
Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in
the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk,
Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro
through that ancient road-meeting. The home and centre of
the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing
Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from
time beyond record.
‘All the same, observations that I have made on my own
many journeys south have convinced me that the weed itself
is not native to our parts of the world, but came northward
from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I suspect, originally
brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the
North, where it is never found wild, and flourishes only in
warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor
call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only for the fragrance of its
flowers. From that land it must have been carried up the
Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of
Elendil and our own days. But even the Du´nedain of Gondor
allow us this credit: Hobbits first put it into pipes. Not even
the Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one
Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became as
skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.’

Of the Ordering of the Shire
The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings
already referred to, North, South, East, and West; and these
again each into a number of folklands, which still bore the
names of some of the old leading families, although by the
time of this history these names were no longer found only
in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the
Tookland, but that was not true of many other families, such
as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were
the East and West Marches: the Buckland (p. 129); and the
Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.
The Shire at this time had hardly any ‘government’.
Families for the most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time. In
other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy,
but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged for
generations.
There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it,
away north of the Shire. But there had been no king for nearly
a thousand years, and even the ruins of Kings’ Norbury were
covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild folk and
wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the
king. For they attributed to the king of old all their essential
laws; and usually they kept the laws of free will, because they
were The Rules (as they said), both ancient and just.
It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent;
for the office of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne
that title ever since. The Thain was the master of the Shiremoot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-inarms; but as muster and moot were only held in times of
emergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had
ceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family
prologue 13
was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained
both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to
produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar
habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than
generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, of
referring to the head of the family as The Took, and of
adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim
the Second, for instance.
The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor
of Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every
seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe,
that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was
to preside at banquets, given on the Shire-holidays, which
occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of Postmaster
and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he
managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These
were the only Shire-services, and the Messengers were the
most numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no
means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were wrote
constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their
relations) who lived further off than an afternoon’s walk.
The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their
police, or the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They
had, of course, no uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice
rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the
strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire
only twelve of them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work.
A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed to ‘beat
the bounds’, and to see that Outsiders of any kind, great or
small, did not make themselves a nuisance.
At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they
were called, had been greatly increased. There were many
reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures
prowling about the borders, or over them: the first sign that
all was not quite as it should be, and always had been except
14 prologue
in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and
not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty
years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey,
and he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred
as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the
considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or
how little he revealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite ‘nephew’. And he still kept secret the ring that he had
found.

Of the Finding of the Ring
As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo’s door the
great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with
him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them
he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning of
April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest
of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the
Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East. The
quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded the hoard
was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle of
Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many
deeds of renown were done, the matter would scarcely have
concerned later history, or earned more than a note in
the long annals of the Third Age, but for an ‘accident’ by the
way. The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the
Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it
happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orcmines deep under the mountains, and there, as he groped in
vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor
of a tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere
luck.
Trying to find his way out, Bilbo went on down to the
roots of the mountains, until he could go no further. At the
prologue 15
bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and
on an island of rock in the water lived Gollum. He was a
loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his
large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching
blind fish with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate
any living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it
without a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had
come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a
ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one
thing he loved, his ‘Precious’, and he talked to it, even when
it was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on
his island, except when he was hunting or spying on the orcs
of the mines.
Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring
had been on him when they met; but it was not, and the
hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as
a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the
Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo
could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if
Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished: he
would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.
Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could
neither go on nor back, Bilbo accepted the challenge; and
they asked one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won
the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he
was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his
hand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten:
What have I got in my pocket? This Gollum failed to answer,
though he demanded three guesses.
The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question
was a mere ‘question’ and not a ‘riddle’ according to the strict
rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and
trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his
promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for the
thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove
false, even though such promises were held sacred, and of
old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But
16 prologue
after ages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and
treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to his
island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark
water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now,
and angry, and once his ‘Precious’ was with him he would
not fear any weapon at all.
But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was
gone. His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo’s back, though he
did not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had
at last leaped to a guess, too late. What has it got in its
pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a green
flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his
‘Precious’. Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly
up the passage away from the water; and once more he was
saved by his luck. For as he ran he put his hand in his pocket,
and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that
Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to guard
the way out, lest the ‘thief’ should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself
about his ‘Precious’; from which talk at last even Bilbo
guessed the truth, and hope came to him in the darkness: he
himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape
from the orcs and from Gollum.
At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening
that led to the lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side
of the mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling
and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his
sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, in
which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill
the wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering
his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled
away down the passage, pursued by his enemy’s cries of hate
and despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!
Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo
first told it to his companions. To them his account was that
Gollum had promised to give him a present, if he won the
prologue 17
game; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he
found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been
given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this
was the very ring that he had found, and as he had won the
game, it was already his by right. But being in a tight place,
he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the
way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo
set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered
it himself, not even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it
still appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several of
the copies and abstracts. But many copies contain the true
account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by
Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though
they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually
written by the old hobbit himself.
Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon
as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the
ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much
questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but
the wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he
did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and
disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the
truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a
‘present’ was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It
was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk
that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his
‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought
strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth
in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this
book.
Of Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here.
With the help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at
the gate and rejoined his companions. He used the ring many
times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he
kept it secret from them as long as he could. After his return
to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf
18 note on the shire records
and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence,
or so he believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of
his Journey that he was writing.
His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his
coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the
Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving
Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End
the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels;
and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his
pocket.
He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in
his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable
occurred in the Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for the celebration of his hundred-and-eleventh
birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History begins.
note on the shire records
At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits
in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the
Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected and
written down. The greater families were also concerned with
events in the Kingdom at large, and many of their members
studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of the
first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found
in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical
books and records.
The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of
the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book
of Westmarch. That most important source for the history
of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long
preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns,
note on the shire records 19
Wardens of the Westmarch.* It was in origin Bilbo’s private
diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it
back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes,
and during S.R. 1420–1 he nearly filled its pages with his
account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it,
probably in a single red case, were the three large volumes,
bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift.
To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a
fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other
matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.
The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many
copies were made, especially of the first volume, for the use
of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The
most important copy, however, has a different history. It was
kept at Great Smials, but it was written in Gondor, probably
at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended
this note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this work in IV
172. It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain’s Book in
Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of
King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was
brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to
Gondor in IV 64.
The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red
Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost. In
Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish
languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated version
of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie
outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have
been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir,
some time after the passing of the King. But the chief importance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains the whole of
Bilbo’s ‘Translations from the Elvish’. These three volumes

were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which,
between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available
to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they
were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned
with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.
Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their
great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions
with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and
Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red
Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with
Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were
composed or begun by Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire
he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore of the Shire, and
for his Reckoning of Years in which he discussed the relation
of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell,
Gondor, and Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old
Words and Names in the Shire, showing special interest in
discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim
of such ‘shire-words’ as mathom and old elements in place
names.
At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shirefolk, though more important for larger history. None of them
was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected
many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly
copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to Elendil
and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Nu´menor and the arising of
Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that The Tale of
Years* was put together, with the assistance of material
collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often
conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and
information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once.
There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained,

together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that
Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel;
but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the
Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of
the Elder Days in Middle-earth.
